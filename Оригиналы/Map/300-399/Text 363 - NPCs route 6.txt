Here on Route 6, there's a place called\nMistralton Cave.\xF000븁\x0000\nSupposedly, deep in that cave you can\nfind an amazing Pokémon called Cobalion,\xF000븀\x0000\nwho was said to have protected Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nfrom a sea of fire in ancient Unova.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you can use a move called Surf\nthat lets you move over the water's\xF000븀\x0000\nsurface, maybe you can see Cobalion.
I've heard that there are also Pokémon\nthat should be called Cobalion's allies.
Now what should I do?\xF000븁\x0000\nThe entrance to Chargestone Cave,\njust ahead, is blocked off.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's because of a Pokémon called\nGalvantula, and if I don't ask Clay\xF000븀\x0000\nto do something, there's no way to pass.
Chargestone Cave seems like\na complicated maze, but actually\xF000븀\x0000\nit's a straight road.
Pokémon with Dry Skin love Water-type\nmoves and rainy weather. ♪\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm talking about the Ability\nof these Pokémon, of course.
