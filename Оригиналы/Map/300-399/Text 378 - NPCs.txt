\xF000Ă\x0001\x0000 seems to want to get out of\nthe Poké Ball!\xF000븁\x0000\nWill you let it out?
The Poké Ball has stopped moving...
\xF000Ă\x0001\x0000 came jumping out!\xF000븁\x0000
Ooh! That Pokémon! It couldn't be...\xF000븁\x0000\nA bright red mane...and a lush tail...and\na single, noble horn!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's exactly like the old legend!\xF000븁\x0000
Long ago, when a war between people\nstarted an intense fire in this forest,\xF000븀\x0000\na single young Pokémon was separated\xF000븀\x0000\nfrom its parents.\xF000븁\x0000\nCobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion\nteamed up to take care of this Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000
The three acted as its parents and\ntaught it the knowledge and the moves\xF000븀\x0000\nit needed to survive...\xF000븁\x0000
The young Pokémon grew rapidly, and\ndeveloped a power that surpassed its\xF000븀\x0000\nthree caretakers.\xF000븁\x0000\nHowever... One day, that Pokémon\ndisappeared from the forest.\xF000븁\x0000\nNo one knows why. But when I think about\nit... Young ones are always reckless and\xF000븀\x0000\ndrawn to adventure...\xF000븁\x0000
It looks like they are all happy to see\none another again!\xF000븁\x0000\nI wonder if those three are trying to\nteach Keldeo something?\xF000븁\x0000
Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion are\ntrying to teach \xF000Ă\x0001\x0000 the new move\xF000븀\x0000\nSecret Sword!\xF000븁\x0000\nTeach Secret Sword to \xF000Ă\x0001\x0000?



If it weren't for you, these Pokémon\nnever would have been able to meet again\xF000븀\x0000\nhere in this forest that holds so many\xF000븀\x0000\nmemories for them.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm sure they are very happy that they\nwere able to meet a Trainer like you.\xF000븁\x0000
It seems like it's looking for the three\nlegendary Pokémon that raised it:\xF000븀\x0000\nCobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion.\xF000븁\x0000\nMaybe something will happen if you bring\nthem here, too...\xF000븁\x0000
How you raise Keldeo is up to you...\xF000븁\x0000\nSometimes it's necessary to think about\nthings carefully rather than acting on\xF000븀\x0000\nthe spur of the moment.\xF000븁\x0000
For Keldeo and the three legendary\nPokémon of the Unova region--Cobalion,\xF000븀\x0000\nTerrakion, and Virizion--this forest\xF000븀\x0000\nhas a special meaning.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt seems like it would be best if you knew\nthis story, as well.\xF000븁\x0000\nWould you mind listening to an old man's\nstory for a moment?\xF000븁\x0000
When you want to teach Keldeo this move,\nyou must bring Cobalion, Terrakion,\xF000븀\x0000\nand Virizion.\xF000븁\x0000
A verdant forest and clear water... For\nPokémon, this forest is like a paradise.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's also very important for people,\nso I want to take good care of it!
Would you like to teach Keldeo this\nmove again?
If you don't get to do something you\nwanted to do, it sure stays with you.\xF000븁\x0000
