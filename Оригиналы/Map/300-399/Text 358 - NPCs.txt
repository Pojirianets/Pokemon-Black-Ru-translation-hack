Deep in the desert ahead of here,\nat the Desert Resort,\xF000븀\x0000\nthere are some ruins that have\xF000븀\x0000\nbecome a little tourist destination!
Cheren: I believe it would be wise for me\nto catch some Ground-type Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nOr perhaps I should strengthen my\nPokémon. What's my best path forward?
Cheren: Hey, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xF000븁\x0000\nI've been waiting for you to get\nthe Insect Badge.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd now it's time to see which one of us\nis the stronger Trainer!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: It's now clear to me.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe reason you are so tough is the trust\nbetween you and your Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut...that shouldn't be a problem.\xF000븁\x0000\nI can get more out of \xF000ā\x0001\x0000\nand my other Pokémon, too.\xF000븁\x0000
The Xtransceiver is ringing.

Cheren: Nimbasa City's gate is\nstraight down Route 4.\xF000븁\x0000
When I look at the freeway,\nI feel exhilarated!
Ruins buried in the desert...\nIt's like a grand adventure in a story.
Oh! Trainer, take a look at the sand.\xF000븁\x0000\nDo you see how some areas are lighter?\nAnd some of the sand looks...darker...\xF000븁\x0000\nPokémon are hiding in the darker sand!
Route 4

Trainer Tips!\xF000븁\x0000\n\nPokémon have a source of energy\nfor using moves.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's called PP, meaning Power Points.\nThey have PP for each move.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen a move has no PP remaining,\nthat Pokémon cannot use that move.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's a good time to head for\nthe Pokémon Center!
Tired Workers should head\nto the prefab house by Castelia City!
