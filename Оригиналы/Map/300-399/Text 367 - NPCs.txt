The Pokémon climbed up the rock wall and\ndisappeared somewhere into the cave...
The strength you exhibited communicating\nwith your Pokémon also got through\xF000븀\x0000\nto Cobalion.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you and your Pokémon train together\nand get even stronger, it will probably\xF000븀\x0000\nreturn to this place.\xF000븁\x0000
It seems that thanks to you, Cobalion\nhas sensed a change in the world.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's a world where people and Pokémon\nhelp each other and live together.\xF000븁\x0000\nI believe Cobalion wants to remain\nwith you and travel by your side.\xF000븁\x0000
The fact that you battled Cobalion and\nyou related to each other should be\xF000븀\x0000\neasily communicated to Terrakion and\xF000븀\x0000\nVirizion because of the close bond\xF000븀\x0000\nbetween the three.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm sure they will also give you a chance\nto prove your worth.\xF000븁\x0000
The obstacles that separated Terrakion\nand Virizion from people are probably\xF000븀\x0000\ngone now.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhether you want to search\nfor those two is up to you,\xF000븀\x0000\nbut they are definitely waiting for you...\xF000븁\x0000
I saw your skill. It's impressive for one\nso young.\xF000븁\x0000\nMaybe you're the one...\nHmmm... It may be possible...\xF000븁\x0000\nHow about it? Will you listen to\nan old man's story?
In the distant past, when Pokémon and\npeople lived in different worlds,\xF000븀\x0000\na war between people started\xF000븀\x0000\nan intense fire in a forest where\xF000븀\x0000\nmany Pokémon lived.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe Pokémon were surrounded by smoke\nand flames. They were in big trouble.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd then, the legends Cobalion,\nTerrakion, and Virizion appeared!\xF000븁\x0000\nTerrakion used its amazing strength to\ndestroy rocks blocking the\xF000븀\x0000\nescape route.\xF000븁\x0000\nVirizion used its quick movements\nto protect Pokémon from looming flames.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd Cobalion led the frightened\nPokémon out of the burning woods.\xF000븁\x0000
The people who started the war were\nrouted by the power of the legends.\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause of Cobalion, Terrakion, and\nVirizion, the war was ended.\xF000븁\x0000
When people fight, there's no peace for\nPokémon, either.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe three legends learned that\nthe deeds of humans could lead\xF000븀\x0000\nto dire consequences for their world.\xF000븁\x0000
They cut themselves off from people\nand disappeared.\xF000븁\x0000\nNo one saw much of them after that, and\nthe three faded into myth...\xF000븁\x0000
I've been searching for them for\ndecades, and I finally figured out that\xF000븀\x0000\none of them was deep in this cave.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut the legendary three do not\ntrust people.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf people approach, they bare their\nfangs and attack.\xF000븁\x0000
It can't be helped, because they only\nknow the old world...\xF000븁\x0000\nThey still don't know the world has\nbecome a place where people and Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\ntry to understand and help each other.\xF000븁\x0000
You seem like you might be able to show\nthem that people and Pokémon can trust\xF000븀\x0000\neach other and live together.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf they take another look at people,\nI think they will stop hiding from us...\xF000븁\x0000
It's not just about bonds between\npeople and Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nHaving all living things appreciate and\ntrust each other would be best.
If you don't listen to what your elders\nhave to say, I can't expect much\xF000븀\x0000\nfrom you!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou shouldn't have come to this place!\nLeave now!\xF000븁\x0000
