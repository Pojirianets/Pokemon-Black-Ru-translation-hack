I'm making a delicious soup with\nwell-stewed vegetables.
Since her yammering stops while she's\ncooking, it's another bonus for me.
Even a young 'un like yourself will catch\ncold if you get soaked by that cold rain.\xF000븁\x0000\nSit right down and have some soup,\nwhy don't you?
That's nice. A young 'un like you\nshouldn't be shy.\xF000븁\x0000
Come now, just have a little.\nIt's good for you.\xF000븁\x0000\nWould you listen to an old lady's story\nfor a moment?\xF000븁\x0000
In the Unova region, you see, there is a\nPokémon called Thundurus\xF000븀\x0000\nthat creates thunderstorms.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt flies around the region and sets loose\nwild winds and crashing lightning.\xF000븁\x0000
In the Unova region, you see, there is a\nPokémon called Tornadus that\xF000븀\x0000\ncauses windstorms.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt flies around the region while letting\nloose wild winds and pounding rain.\xF000븁\x0000
Have some soup now, dear.\nIt'll warm you up.\xF000븁\x0000
A soup jam-packed with healthy\nvegetables. It's delicious!\xF000븁\x0000
The heavy rain is ruining the crops\nI've worked so hard to raise!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat a troublesome Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
I thought I would try to catch it, but it\nflies around so fast that even when I\xF000븀\x0000\nthought I'd found it, it just flew away.\xF000븁\x0000
In one day, it can make a lap around the\nentire Unova region.\xF000븁\x0000\nIn the mornings, it's in the south,\nand in the evenings, it's in the north.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt shows up here in the evenings!
It seems like someone somewhere\ntaught that stormy Pokémon a lesson.\xF000븁\x0000\nI wonder if it was...?
Long ago, I was a sharp-lookin' young\nman, and my wife was a fiiine-lookin' girl.\xF000븀\x0000\nThis is a story from way back then.\xF000븁\x0000\nRight around here, a certain Pokémon\ntaught a lesson to Thundurus, who had\xF000븀\x0000\nbeen causin' trouble dropping lightning.\xF000븁\x0000\nFor around 30 years after that,\nThundurus kept calm, and it hid\xF000븀\x0000\nsomewhere around here.

If you go in the tall grass during\na storm, it might pop out.
There is a Pokémon that\nquieted Thundurus.\xF000븁\x0000\nI remember hearing that there is a\nshrine built to honor that Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nsomewhere on Route 14.

Oh my. Your Pokémon team...\xF000븁\x0000\nIt seems all worn out.\nRest for just a moment now!\xF000븁\x0000
Walking on the raised walkways\nis more tiring than you think, right?
Granny's meals are always\nnothing but vegetables!
Know the electric bulletin boards?\xF000븁\x0000\nThey'll tell you when lightning is\ncrashing down somewhere!
