I come shop at the Shopping Mall a lot\nbecause I want all the TMs!
On the first floor, they sell medicines.\xF000븁\x0000\nOn the second floor, they sell TMs\nand different kinds of Mail.\xF000븁\x0000\nOn the third floor, they sell items for\nraising stats and battle items.\xF000븁\x0000\nI really admire Mr. Clyde, the\nPokémon Gym guide, so I'm practicing\xF000븀\x0000\nbeing a guide, too!
There are even some people in the mall\nwho will challenge you to battles.
The thing I buy most often is the item\nthat raises a Pokémon's HP, called HP Up.\xF000븁\x0000\nThere are also a lot of other items that\ncatch my eye.









Good Trainers never use only\nbrute force.\xF000븁\x0000\nThey think about many different\nstrategies, such as which Pokémon and\xF000븀\x0000\nmoves to use in battle, or the best time\xF000븀\x0000\nto use an item.
Playing hide-and-seek would be fun!
Welcome to Shopping Mall Nine!\nIt's called Nine because it's on Route 9.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou can remember it by thinking of this:\n“Done shopping? Nein!"
Have you heard? There's a cave\nalong Route 9.\xF000븁\x0000\nI don't know exactly where it is or\nwhat's in it, though.
Hey! Pokémon Trainer!\xF000븁\x0000\nDo you know about an item called\nthe Thunderstone?
So you know Thunderstones make certain\nPokémon evolve, then? Niiice!\xF000븁\x0000
Well then, I'll tell you!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you use the Thunderstone, it makes\ncertain Pokémon evolve!\xF000븁\x0000
Meeting here must be fate!\nThis is for you!\xF000븁\x0000
I've heard a Pokémon called Eelektrik\nevolves with the Thunderstone.
Shopping Mall Nine\nColorful and wonderful!
