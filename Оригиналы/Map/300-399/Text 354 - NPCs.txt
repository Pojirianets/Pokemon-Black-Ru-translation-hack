I happen to be the daughter of the\ncouple running the Pokémon Day Care\xF000븀\x0000\nnext door!\xF000븁\x0000\nI know, it's sweet, isn't it?\xF000븁\x0000\nParents and daughter all bringing up\nyoungsters for a living.\xF000븁\x0000\nHelping Pokémon and people grow up\nhealthy is a wonderful thing!
Are you familiar with Double Battles?
Oh, I do love explaining how things work.\xF000븁\x0000\nNow, a Double Battle is a Pokémon battle\nwith two Pokémon on each side.\xF000븁\x0000\nChoosing two that combine well is vital.
You do have a Gym Badge, after all.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou're well aware that Double Battles\nare Pokémon battles where each side\xF000븀\x0000\nuses two Pokémon!
Seriously. Guys are all just little boys.
Yeah! Yeah!
Rrrraaaaar!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll run! You gonna chase me? \nYou run! Am I gonna chase you?\xF000븁\x0000\nChange your perspective--\nand the reality changes.
Your Pokémon are really energetic!
Um-hmm.\nYour Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000\nThey don't seem to be healthy.\nLet them rest here a little bit!\xF000븁\x0000
