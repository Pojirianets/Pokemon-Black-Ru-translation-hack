Professor Juniper: Now that everyone's\nhere, I'll explain.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe Pokédex's pages update automatically\nwhenever you meet a Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nMoreover, it's set up so that\nyou obtain even more information\xF000븀\x0000\nwhen you catch a Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nTo make this clear, I'm going to\ndemonstrate how to catch a Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: Did you see that,\njust now?\xF000븁\x0000\nHere's how it goes, step by step.\nFirst, reduce the Pokémon's HP!\xF000븁\x0000\nPokémon that still have all of\ntheir energy are difficult to catch.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you can, use your Pokémon's moves to\nmake the Pokémon you want to catch\xF000븀\x0000\nfall asleep. Or paralyze it!\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd to wrap this up in the best way,\nI have a gift for you--some Poké Balls!\xF000븁\x0000

Professor Juniper: Poké Balls are used\nfor catching Pokémon and for carrying\xF000븀\x0000\nthe Pokémon you catch!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm going on ahead.\nI'll be waiting for you in Accumula Town!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: She forgot to say that Pokémon\njump out at you in the tall grass.\xF000븁\x0000
I'm heading to Accumula Town, too.\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: I think I'll go, too.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm looking forward to the next town\nso I can go shopping for Poké Balls!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Wait a minute!\xF000븁\x0000\nHey, listen!\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, Cheren,\xF000븀\x0000\nI thought of something fun!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: But we need to get going!\nI'd imagine the professor's waiting, too.\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Would you just listen a sec?\nSeriously!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhy don't we see who can catch\nthe most Pokémon?\xF000븁\x0000\nThe person carrying the most Pokémon,\nincluding the one received from\xF000븀\x0000\nProfessor Juniper, is the winner!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Huh.\nActually, that sounds interesting.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt will fill up Pokédex pages, so I'm\nsure it will please the professor, too.\xF000븁\x0000\nOK, then. Until we reach Accumula Town,\ntake care of healing your Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nat your own house.\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Me and \xF000ā\x0001\x0000\nwill do the best for sure!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, are you going to\ncompare yourself with Bianca?\xF000븁\x0000\nBoth Bianca and I have two Pokémon\nwith us.
Bianca: How about it, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000?\xF000븁\x0000\nDo you want to compare which one\nof us has the most Pokémon with them?
Bianca: Hmm...\nGuess I'll be waiting here, then.\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Wow, \xF000Ȁ\x0001\x0000?! That's awesome!\xF000븁\x0000\nAre you excited to have that many\nPokémon with you?\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Seems the number of Pokémon\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 has is...\xF000븁\x0000\nTwo!\nWe all have the same number, then!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: What? What? What?\nYou only have \xF000ā\x0001\x0000?!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you don't catch any Pokémon, won't\n\xF000ā\x0001\x0000 get lonely?\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Incidentally, if you check your\nPokédex, you'll see how many Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nyou've found and how many\xF000븀\x0000\nyou've caught.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm off to Accumula Town!\nThe professor is waiting.\xF000븁\x0000

The Xtransceiver is ringing.
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 picked up the Xtransceiver.\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Well, I'm going on ahead.\xF000븁\x0000
Is your Pokémon's HP all right?\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen your Pokémon's HP decreases while\nyou're on the road, it can be\xF000븀\x0000\na big problem, so I'll give you this.\xF000븁\x0000\nPut it in your Bag's Medicine Case.\xF000븁\x0000
When your Pokémon's HP decreases,\nthey no longer have the energy to fight.\xF000븁\x0000\nSo, don't push your Pokémon too hard,\nand let them rest often.
Wild Pokémon are hiding in the tall grass.\nWhat does this mean for you?\xF000븁\x0000\nIt means when you want to battle\nor capture wild Pokémon,\xF000븀\x0000\nyou should go walk in the tall grass.
