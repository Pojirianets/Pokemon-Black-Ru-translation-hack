Cheren: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, stop!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou've got a Bolt Badge...\nI've got a Bolt Badge...\xF000븁\x0000\nLet's test who's stronger--you or me!\nThis time, I'm going to win!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Why?\nWhy can't I beat you?\xF000븁\x0000
Elesa: Oh, you two are friends...\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's nice, how you're helping each\nother get better by competing.\xF000븁\x0000
OK, let's go.\xF000븁\x0000
???: Oh!\nWhy, if it isn't Elesa!\xF000븁\x0000
???: Aren't festivals grand?\nLife should be enjoyed!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Who is this man?\xF000븁\x0000
Elesa: This is Alder,\nthe Unova region's Champion.\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Champion?!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhy would the Champion be\ngoofing off in a place like this?\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: I heard that remark.\nYou're quite a judgmental young person,\xF000븀\x0000\nare you not?\xF000븁\x0000\nMy name is Alder. I'm the Unova\nPokémon League's Champion.\xF000븁\x0000\nPleased to make your acquaintance.\xF000븁\x0000\nFor your information, I'm not\ngoofing off. I'm on a voyage.\xF000븀\x0000\nI know every corner of Unova.\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Um. I'm Cheren, from\nNuvema Town.\xF000븁\x0000\nMy goal as a Trainer is to\nbecome the Champion.\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: Hm. Traveling with a goal in mind\nis a commendable thing.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd what do you plan to do\nafter becoming the Champion?\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: What else is there other than\nstriving to become stronger?\xF000븁\x0000\nThe strongest Trainer--\nthat's the Champion.\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: Hmm. Becoming stronger...\nBecoming stronger, you say...\xF000븀\x0000\nIs that alone enough of a goal? Hmmm.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's not that I'm trying to say your way\nof thinking is wrong...\xF000븁\x0000
In my travels, I've helped many people\nlearn to love Pokémon. I think that's\xF000븀\x0000\nimportant, too.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you play with those children,\nyou might gain more of an understanding.\xF000븁\x0000\nWill you two have a Pokémon battle\nwith those two?\xF000븁\x0000
Hey, you two. Come\nhere for a moment.\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: ...Understood.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut, before that...\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren fully healed \n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000's Pokémon!
Cheren: OK, let's battle.\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: Nicely done! You didn't win, but\nthat was a good battle. Your Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nlooked like they were having fun.\xF000븁\x0000
Young man, if there are people\nlike you who pursue strength,\xF000븀\x0000\nthere are also people who are\xF000븀\x0000\nhappy just being with Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nThere are many different people\nand many different answers.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen it comes to what a Champion\nshould be, you and I may hold differing\xF000븀\x0000\nviews, but so be it! Give it some thought.\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: It's tremendous that people and\nPokémon, each so different, can\xF000븀\x0000\nacknowledge each other and be together!
Alder is so strong!\nAnd he's nice to Pokémon!
I was scared of Pokémon, but Alder\ntaught me that they're nice and friendly.
Elesa: Let's roll.\nThe Driftveil Drawbridge is just ahead.\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: The Champion is the strongest\nof the strong! That's all there is to it.\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: This way.\xF000븁\x0000
Elesa: Now to contact him...\xF000븁\x0000
It's me, Elesa.\nPlease lower the drawbridge.\xF000븁\x0000\nI have a couple of Trainers here\nwho want to challenge you.\xF000븁\x0000\nOK...\nThanks.\xF000븁\x0000
Now, watch this!\xF000븁\x0000
Elesa: I have a TV gig, so I've got to go.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe Gym Leader of the next town\nmay take some getting used to...\xF000븀\x0000\nDo your best, both of you.\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: What I am is a Trainer.\xF000븁\x0000\nI prove I'm right by getting stronger\nand winning in battle--\xF000븀\x0000\neven against the Champion.\xF000븁\x0000
Excuse me!\nPlease stop right there!\xF000븁\x0000
The drawbridge is raised right now\nso ships can pass. You can't cross.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you make a request to Driftveil's Gym\nLeader, Clay, he could... Well, I'm not\xF000븀\x0000\nsure how you'd reach him over there...\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you talk to Nimbasa City's Gym Leader,\nElesa, she might be able to do something.

A bridge would be meaningless\nif no one ever crossed it.\xF000븁\x0000\nBridges connect the world...\nThat's as solid as a symbol can get.
Hum fiercely! My battle song!\nBattle fiercely! My Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
In battling you, I came to understand...\xF000븁\x0000\nYou're the best!\nHere! This is for you!\xF000븁\x0000


If you want your Pokémon to\nhold this Electric Guitar,\xF000븀\x0000\ngo to the Musical Theater!\xF000븀\x0000\nCooler than cool!
Cheren: Strength and strength alone\nis what matters in this world.\xF000븁\x0000\nSo I believed, until I met Alder here.\xF000븁\x0000
But, winning in Pokémon battles\nisn't all there is to life.\xF000븁\x0000\nOnce I learned that lesson, my eyes\nwere opened to many different things.\xF000븁\x0000
We all have our own brand of strength,\npeople and Pokémon both.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe strength to make our dreams\na reality, the strength to protect\xF000븀\x0000\nwhat we hold most dear...\xF000븁\x0000
Why do I think this way now?\nIt's thanks to you, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000...\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd Bianca...\nAnd Alder...\xF000븁\x0000\nIf only N could see this, too, someday.\xF000븁\x0000
I'm going to take a long, hard look\nat myself on Victory Road.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm going to think about what I can do\nand who I can become...\xF000븁\x0000\nVisit me sometime, if you want.\nWe'll have a battle like old times.\xF000븁\x0000
The Pokémon and the performers\nall have amazing moves!
I think being able to make people\nsmile is a super-awesome talent!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's why Pokémon are so awesome!\nBecause they can make you smile!
The street performers are my favorites.\nThey're so charming!
