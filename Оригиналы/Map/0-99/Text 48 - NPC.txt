I am not as good an artist as Burgh,\nbut I have a liking for paintings.\xF000븁\x0000\nLet me see. Today, I'd like to paint\n\xF000ă\x0001\x0000-type Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nWill you show me what kinds of Pokémon\nyou have?
Please show me a Pokémon that's\n\xF000ă\x0001\x0000 type!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh! You have that type!\nI'm inspired!\xF000븁\x0000\nThank you! As a token of my gratitude,\nwhich one would you like?
Cheri Berry
Chesto Berry
Pecha Berry

One \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0000!\nIt's all yours now!\xF000븁\x0000
Aww. You are the best!\nPlease come back tomorrow, too!
As long as the artist enjoys creating\nan artwork, it doesn't matter if the\xF000븀\x0000\nresult is judged as bad or good.
If you catch a Pokémon that's\n\xF000ă\x0001\x0000 type, please show it to me!\xF000븀\x0000\nI'll give you a little something.
The Pokémon you chose is not the one\nI requested.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat I want to paint is a Pokémon that's\n\xF000ă\x0001\x0000 type!
Oh!\nThe shape of this Egg...\xF000븁\x0000\nSuperb! It gives me chills!\nIt's electrifying! It makes me tremble!\xF000븁\x0000\nAlas, even I cannot tell what type\nan Egg is!
