Bianca: A. Mazing. Isn't it?\xF000븁\x0000
Hello, you two! How do you do?\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm the owner of this theater.\nPleasure to meet you!\xF000븁\x0000
Ooh! I must say that you two seem like\nphenomenal Trainers!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat do we do here? We use Props to make\nyour Pokémon fashionable and glamorous!\xF000븁\x0000\nDo you want to join in and play Dress Up?\nTo get you started, here's a Prop Case!\xF000븁\x0000
This Prop Case lets you store Props for\ndecorating your Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nFirst off, you need to pick a Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
Aw, I'm sorry, but that Pokémon can't\nplay Dress Up. Please choose a\xF000븀\x0000\ndifferent Pokémon next time.\xF000븁\x0000
Hmm, I guess I get it! You are expressing\nyour Pokémon's innate charm by choosing\xF000븀\x0000\nnot to decorate it!\xF000븁\x0000\nHonestly, though, I think using Props\nwould be better received in this musical.\xF000븁\x0000
Now, now. Don't be like that.\nPlease reconsider and select a Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
Then... It's time to play Dress Up!\xF000븁\x0000
Wow! The two of you did a fantastic job\ncoordinating everything!\xF000븀\x0000\nUtterly charming!\xF000븁\x0000
If you have a Pokémon who can play\nDress Up, you can participate in the\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon Musical!\xF000븁\x0000\nWould you two please join us?\nThe receptionist can explain everything.\xF000븁\x0000\nLet us say a brief farewell!\nI eagerly anticipate seeing you on stage!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Oh, I don't know what to do!\xF000븁\x0000\nDoing the musical would be totally cool,\nbut there's other stuff I wanna do.\xF000븁\x0000\nOK, that's it! I made up my mind!\nI'm going to see the sights in Nimbasa!\xF000븁\x0000\nSee ya, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000
We really want you to participate in\nthe musical!\xF000븁\x0000\nI apologize in advance if any of our\nProps don't suit some kinds of Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nPokémon are individuals, after all!
Wait! Please, wait!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou participated in a musical\nwith your friends, right?\xF000븁\x0000\nI felt like you opened up new possibilities\nfor musicals!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's why I feel impelled to give you\nthis present! Please accept it!\xF000븁\x0000
I eagerly anticipate seeing you\non stage again!
Your continued participation makes me\na happy owner!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou're attracting a lot of attention as\nan up-and-coming stylist.\xF000븁\x0000\nOf course, I'm watching you closely,\nas well.\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease accept this as a token of\nmy appreciation.\xF000븁\x0000
Ah, I eagerly anticipate seeing you\non stage again!\xF000븁\x0000\n...Actually, it feels like I've said this\nline before.\xF000븁\x0000\nWell, that's OK. Because I'm the owner!
Seeing your continued participation\nmakes me a happy owner.\xF000븁\x0000\nApparently, some audience members have\nbeen calling you a top stylist as of late!\xF000븁\x0000\nBest of all... How impressive am I for\nrecognizing your talent?\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease accept this as a token of\nmy gratitude!\xF000븁\x0000
I hope you continue to enjoy the musical!
Happy birthday!\nI've got this festive Prop to give you!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's a cake from me, the owner!\xF000븁\x0000\nOf course, this is a Prop, so you should\nattach it to your Pokémon and not eat it.\xF000븁\x0000\nBy the way, even if today isn't your\nbirthday, I won't take it back!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhy?\nBecause I'm the owner!\xF000븁\x0000
I want to make Pokémon more glamorous\nthan ever before, so I'm researching the\xF000븀\x0000\nstyles others use when playing Dress Up.
Great work! I saw your Pokémon up\nthere today!\xF000븁\x0000\nOverall, totally \xF000ģ\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe \xF000ģ\x0001\x0001 Prop\nwas a great accent.\xF000븁\x0000\nI noticed that your \xF000ģ\x0001\x0002\nfactor was a bit subdued today.\xF000븁\x0000\nOK! I'm not going to lose!
Gwah!
When you play Dress Up, matching the\nshow you're performing in is im-por-tant!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf it's a good match, you can win the\nhearts of the audience!\xF000븀\x0000\nYou'll be sure to attract attention.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you're going to get on stage,\nit's a waste if you don't stand out!
Pokémon Props each have their own image:\ncool, cute, elegant, or quirky.\xF000븁\x0000\nBefore you play Dress Up, take a moment\nto think about the image you prefer.
I'm not trying to brag, but we're\nrather rich.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen you say rich people, you think\nmusical. It's a matter of taste, I guess.
It is such a treat when Trainers have\nplayed Dress Up with their Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nwith such charming results.
Your Pokémon are wonderful!\nI'm always watching them.\xF000븁\x0000\nI hope you can keep entertaining us with\nyour performances.
I always make sure to watch the\nshows you participate in!\xF000븁\x0000\nEven from the perspective of a rich man\nlike me, it's impressive!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's unparalleled entertainment!
There is a Musical Photo saved from\nlast time!\xF000븁\x0000
You can hang Musical Photos from your\nprevious shows here.
Know what? When there are cute Pokémon,\nmy eyes are glued to the stage!
Originally, people performed in this\nMusical Theater.\xF000븁\x0000\nOne time, a Pokémon wandered up on\nstage and started imitating the actors.\xF000븁\x0000\nEverybody thought it was sensational!\nTa-daaa! The Pokémon Musical was born.
If you are active in the musical, people\nwill become your fans and give you Props.\xF000븁\x0000\nI don't have any Props, so I'll give you\nthis instead!\xF000븁\x0000
With the move Echoed Voice, the power is\nboosted more and more if it's used\xF000븀\x0000\nevery turn.\xF000븁\x0000\nHaving a group use it might work well!
Persistence is important, so keep\nparticipating in the musical, and keep\xF000븀\x0000\nusing Echoed Voice!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou'll make more fans in the musical, and\nyou'll do more damage with Echoed Voice!
Musical Theater\nProps + Music + Dance = Moving Spectacle!
The seats are beyond this entrance,\nbut I think you belong on the\xF000븀\x0000\nspectacular stage!
