
Leo: Check me out! The excitement\nof the big city has made me stronger!\xF000븁\x0000
Looks like I wasn't wound up enough...\nI need a little more urban atmosphere.
Maybe all of this excitement is\na little too much for me...
Living in a fast-paced environment\nhelps with a person's growth.\xF000븀\x0000\nThis city is a model for those words.
Silvia: My glasses have locked onto you!\nLet's have a Pokémon battle!\xF000븁\x0000
Th-there’s a crack in my glasses.\nThat was a smashing battle!
The time I've spent here has been\nreally fun and wonderful!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut, being this surrounded by excitement\nmakes you miss nature somehow!
All the buildings reflected in my glasses\nare dazzling enough to make me dizzy!
Dave: Hey! You've got it goin' on!\nLet's get a Pokémon battle goin'\xF000븀\x0000\nto see who's got it goin' on the most!\xF000븁\x0000
No one's got it goin' on more than you!\nYou can hang out with all the tough guys!
The life of a tough guy in the city is\na little much.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhite Forest is looking better\nall the time.
This city is big and tough, just like me!\nWhat do you think of me now? I've got it\xF000븀\x0000\ngoin' on as much as it will go! Right?
Britney: Hey there! You over thataway!\nHave a Pokémon battle with me!\xF000븁\x0000\nBring heaps of cute Pokémon, OK?\xF000븁\x0000
Whoa, what was that?!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou are way strong!\nThere's no chance I'm keepin' up!
All the racket in this city is getting\nto be too much.\xF000븁\x0000\nI want to lie on my back in the\nwide-open spaces!
I have to try somethin' awful to keep up\nwith city life! But I still enjoy it a bit.
Robbie: In Black City, my groove's\ngetting into a groove! And in battle,\xF000븀\x0000\nI'll never lose!\xF000븁\x0000
Ooh, now I'm grooveless.\nBut I'll get my groove back, so\xF000븀\x0000\nlet's battle again sometime!
Aaah! I've grooved my way into a rut!\nI want to take a break in White Forest!
Developing and developing.\nBlack City changes every day!\xF000븀\x0000\nI love that about this place!
Miki: Hello!\nI'm a fan of sudden beginnings!\xF000븁\x0000\nLet's get right to the Pokémon battle!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, gosh. I already lost?\nSudden endings, I'm not such a fan of!
It's too busy and noisy, and it's enough\nto make a slow-paced person like me\xF000븀\x0000\ndizzy. I want to relax in White Forest.
I was worried, since I'm a little laid back\nand do things at my own speed,\xF000븀\x0000\nthat Black City and I aren't a good fit.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut it'll work out, and it's fun here!
Ryder: Hyah! Hello!\nI want to test my strength against you!\xF000븀\x0000\nThat's OK, right?\xF000븁\x0000
Huh... So that's how much I've improved.\xF000븁\x0000\nThanks! Battling with you\nhas given me a goal!
Hyah! Hyah... Hyah?\nMy heart's not really into it.\xF000븀\x0000\nMaybe I just can't concentrate here.
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!!\xF000븁\x0000\nSince strong people gather here, it's\nthe optimal place for a test of strength!
Karenna: Faster! Faster! I'm ready\nto go! Please spar with me!\xF000븁\x0000
Thank you very much! I still haven't\ntrained enough. I need to be faster!
There are many things to learn from\nbattle, but to improve on what I learned,\xF000븀\x0000\nI want to run and train in the forest.
There is a lot to learn from battles!\nI want to battle more and more!
Doug: Hello, hello! Nice to work with you!\xF000븁\x0000\nHow about a Pokémon battle to celebrate\nour new acquaintance?\xF000븁\x0000
Hey! You must be Unova's best!
Black City has everything! But if there's\none thing it's missing, it's...\xF000븁\x0000\nNature! Relaxation! I want to relax!
Black City is full of hustle and bustle!\nI'm sure my work will progress here!
Vincent: You don't really think you can\nbeat me, Black City's Ace Trainer?\xF000븁\x0000
An Ace Trainer like me, losing?!\nThis doesn't count! It just doesn't!
I was born and raised in the city, but\nI think nature is really great.\xF000븀\x0000\nI want to go to White Forest.
The awesomeness of this city\nspices up my life!
Marie: Take deep, deep breaths before\nbattle. When your mind is clear,\xF000븀\x0000\nthe battle can begin!\xF000븁\x0000
I overthought things, and I lost...\xF000븁\x0000\nSometimes just acting on instinct\nmight be better.
I was working on my paper, but now\nI've got writer's block.\xF000븁\x0000\nMaybe getting some fresh air in\nWhite Forest would clear my head.
Black City is really exciting, and there's\nalways so much going on.\xF000븀\x0000\nIt gives me lots of ideas!
Lena: Since I started my journey as a\nPokémon Trainer, I haven't lost\xF000븀\x0000\nmany battles.\xF000븁\x0000\nCan you make me lose?\xF000븁\x0000
Oh. I really lost, didn't I...?\nIt's strange. I'm usually calm, but now\xF000븀\x0000\nI'm a little frustrated.
In the end, everything returns\nto nature, no matter what.\xF000븁\x0000\nSo that's why White Forest may\nbe so calming...
People build buildings because\nthey fear the power of nature.\xF000븀\x0000\nThat's why I feel so calm here...
Carlos: Oh! Hello!\xF000븁\x0000\nWe must've met here because of fate!\nLet's have a Pokémon battle!\xF000븁\x0000
Black City battles really\nmake a person excited, huh?
Hmmm. I think I'd like\nto see somewhere else soon.
Black City has so much to see.\nI never get tired of it!
Molly: If you look at everything while\nwalking, you make eye contact with\xF000븀\x0000\nvarious Trainers.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhich Pokémon will you use, Trainer who\nmet my gaze?\xF000븁\x0000
When you don't feel confident,\nlower your eyes as you walk.\xF000븀\x0000\nThat is a bit of wisdom.
When there is this much commotion,\nit's hard to calm down.\xF000븀\x0000\nI want to relax somewhere quiet.
Black City always feels like it is\ngoing forward. It's really cool, isn't it?
Frederic: Oh! Have a look at this!\xF000븁\x0000\nMy Pokémon is saying it wants to battle\nwith yours!\xF000븁\x0000
My Pokémon is saying that was\na good battle.\xF000븁\x0000\nDon't you think my Pokémon\nis truly well mannered?
I love this place, but my Pokémon\nseems unsatisfied.\xF000븀\x0000\nMaybe I should take it to White Forest.
This is definitely the best place for me.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe constant change and development\nreally put me in high spirits.
Lynette: How do you do?\xF000븁\x0000\nWould you please let me see\nif you are strong or not?\xF000븁\x0000
Ah, you are a strong person!\nI can feel it in my heart.
I've grown a little tired of looking for\nmy Prince Charming.
There are many strong people in this\ncity, so I never get bored!\xF000븁\x0000\nI want to meet more and more\nstrong people!
Pierce: Phew! What a thrilling lifestyle!\xF000븁\x0000\nWant to taste the thrill with\na Pokémon battle?\xF000븁\x0000
That felt like being on the edge!\nIt was thrilling and fun!
Aaahhh. I'm even getting tired of\nthrilling things. I want to pass time\xF000븀\x0000\nslowly and simply with my Pokémon...
Black City is great. It has culture,\nand you can live comfortably.\xF000븁\x0000\nI think when you're picking a place\nto live, living comfortably is important!
Gene: I can't remember how many\nPokémon I've encountered...\xF000븁\x0000\nWhy don't you test your powers\nagainst someone like me?\xF000븁\x0000
Hmmm... I still have a long way to\ngo as a Trainer.
I want to meet more Pokémon\nin my day-to-day life.
You can keep battling more and more\nand test your power here!\xF000븀\x0000\nBlack City is a great city!
Piper: Fight efficiently and without\nwaste! That is my policy!\xF000븁\x0000
Your efficient fighting style\nis truly wonderful!
Maybe there's more to life\nthan efficiency...
Efficiency is everything in\nbattling and in business.\xF000븁\x0000\nBlack City is efficient.\nI like that in a place!
Miho: I'm adorable, and so is my Pokémon!\nDo you think you can win against us?\xF000븁\x0000
How can we lose when we're so cute?
I've been thinking lately that it would be\nbetter for my Pokémon and me to get back\xF000븀\x0000\nto nature...
You can get everything in Black City, so\nI'm sure I can find things that will help\xF000븀\x0000\nme become cuter and stronger!
Shane: You strong? I'm sure you are!\nI'll check by battling with you!\xF000븁\x0000
I see...\nI must be weak, then...
I'm a little tired of living a life where\nI'm worried about how people see me.
In Black City, I can always confirm what\nkind of guy I am by battling others.\xF000븀\x0000\nIt's easy to understand.
Ralph: My feelings! I'll use a Pokémon\nbattle to get them through!\xF000븁\x0000
Did some of my excitement\nget through to you?
Recently, I've been thinking I don't\njust want to try and get my feelings\xF000븀\x0000\nthrough to people, but I also want\xF000븀\x0000\nto listen a little better...\xF000븁\x0000\nI want to live the slow life in\nWhite Forest.
In Black City, you can quickly let me know\nhow you feel!\xF000븁\x0000\nThis directness feels really great!
Eliza: I want this! I want that! But what\nI really want is to beat you in a\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon battle!\xF000븁\x0000
My oh my...\nI lost!
Even if I buy a lot of stuff, I'm still\nunsatisfied... I have times like that!
In Black City, you can get whatever\nyou want! You can live securely!
Collin: Pokémon battles are good\nfor business!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll defeat you and take advantage of\nthe business opportunity!\xF000븁\x0000
My business opportunity!\nIt's going up in smoke!!
Business opportunities don't just come\nrolling your way...\xF000븁\x0000\nMaybe White Forest is a better fit\nfor me...
Time is limited!\xF000븁\x0000\nI want to always give things my all\nso I don't regret anything!
Ken: I've dedicated my life to Pokémon\nbattling. I will win as a specialist!\xF000븁\x0000
I apparently still haven't done enough\nresearch on Pokémon battling.
All I think about every day is\nPokémon battling.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut maybe it would be better\nto think about other things, too...\xF000븀\x0000\nI think that sometimes.
If I'm in Black City, I can focus on\nPokémon battling and get really good!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll try to master one thing!
Jacques: Win or lose!\nContests have a clear answer!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm going to research\nyour battling style.\xF000븁\x0000
The result is a loss.\nIt's a beautiful, clear answer.
Just one answer...\xF000븁\x0000\nI think there may be a way of research\nthat looks for something besides that.
In Black City, you can get a clear answer\nif you battle...\xF000븀\x0000\nIt's satisfying for a researcher.
Rosa: Life is just killing time.\nDon't you think so?\xF000븀\x0000\nPlay with me for a bit!\xF000븁\x0000
I managed to kill some time!
I might not know what to do with a life of\nkilling time every day!
Black City has lots of ways to kill time,\nso I never get bored! It's great!!
Herman: I can't be tied down to a single\nplace... I wander around, and today's\xF000븀\x0000\nanother battle!\xF000븁\x0000
I lost! This city doesn't fit me well.
Just staying in one place...\nI'd like to try living like that.
Wandering and having Pokémon battles!\nI like living like this!
Emi: Pokémon battling...\nThat is the goal for my journey!\xF000븁\x0000
I couldn't win! But this is one of the\nthrills of battling!
Recently, I've been thinking I would like\nto take a more leisurely trip without any\xF000븀\x0000\nparticular destination in mind.
In Black City, I can enjoy Pokémon\nbattles, and it fits my\xF000븀\x0000\njourney perfectly!
Grace: I am about to show you the beauty\nof artistic Pokémon battling!\xF000븀\x0000\nPlease be overwhelmed!\xF000븁\x0000
The combination of you and your Pokémon\nwas very beautiful!!
There is a limit to the beauty a person\ncan create...\xF000븀\x0000\nI feel like that when I look at this city.
My heart dances in delight at the\ncalculated beauty of a city built\xF000븀\x0000\nby people!
Black City\nProsperous and Vibrant
