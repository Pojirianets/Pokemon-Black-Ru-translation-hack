Enjoy the taste of our specialty!
This café has a special on Wednesdays!
As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't\nmatter that the café is in a rural area\xF000븀\x0000\nthat nobody knows.
Do you know about the Battle Box?\xF000븁\x0000\nI heard it is a useful function you can\nuse at the Pokémon Center.
The Striaton City Gym Leaders are a\ngreat triplet combo!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe Grass-type Pokémon user, Cilan,\nchooses great tea leaves.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe Water-type Pokémon user, Cress,\nprepares the best water.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd the Fire-type Pokémon user, Chili,\npours hot water at the right heat.\xF000븁\x0000\nNo wonder their tea is the best!
When you battle with a friend using\nwireless communications, you can use\xF000븀\x0000\nitems using a Wonder Launcher!
Yes, I know!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you have a Wonder Launcher, energy\nwill be charged, and you can use\xF000븀\x0000\nvarious items.
