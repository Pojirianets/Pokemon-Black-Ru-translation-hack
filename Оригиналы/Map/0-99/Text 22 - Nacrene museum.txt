Welcome to the Nacrene Museum!
Those robbers... What in the world is\nTeam Plasma?
You can get to the Pokémon Gym by going\nto the back of the museum!
What do they plan to accomplish by\nstealing the Dragon Skull?
Wow! Whenever I look at this skeleton,\nI'm...fascinated.\xF000븁\x0000
Welcome! I'm Hawes, the\nassistant director.\xF000븁\x0000\nSince you were kind enough to visit,\nI'll give you a tour of the museum.\xF000븁\x0000
This skeleton is of a Dragon-type\nPokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nThere's a theory that it had an accident\nwhile it was flying around the world, and\xF000븀\x0000\nso it became a Fossil.\xF000븁\x0000
This rock is amazing! It's a meteorite!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt contains some kind of energy\nfrom space.\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, this? It's an ordinary old stone.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt was found near the desert, but other\nthan the fact that it's old, it doesn't\xF000븀\x0000\nseem to have any value...\xF000븁\x0000\nWe only display it because it's rather\npretty to look at.\xF000븁\x0000
The Pokémon Gym is just beyond here.\xF000븁\x0000
At the end of the Gym, a very strong\nand kind Gym Leader is waiting.\xF000븁\x0000\nBy the way, the Gym Leader Lenora\nhappens to be my wife!\xF000븁\x0000
At the end of the Gym, a very strong\nand kind Gym Leader is waiting.\xF000븁\x0000\nBy the way, the Gym Leader Lenora\nhappens to be my wife!
Lenora: Now, you wait!\nEnough fooling around!\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: So you've come, Gym Leader.\xF000븁\x0000\nWe, Team Plasma, claim this museum's\nDragon Skull in the name of\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon liberation!\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: To show you we're serious,\nwe'll steal it right before your eyes!\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Well, then, here's\nour smoke screen!\xF000븁\x0000
Plasmaaaa!
Plasmaaaa!
Lenora: What's going on?\xF000븁\x0000
Hawes: Oh! Oh! We have to go after them!\xF000븁\x0000
Hawes: Lenora loves that skull...
Bianca: I won't forgive those thieves!
Cheren: So I can't battle the Gym Leader\nbecause of Team Plasma, huh...\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat a bother.
Skeletal specimens are so mysterious...\xF000븁\x0000\nFrom the outside, you can't see their\nfunctional, efficient design.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's almost as if it is an embodiment of\ntheir former essence... So fascinating!
Rare Pokémon from around the world...\nMuseums are packed with adventure!
My oh my oh my!
The Gym Leader here studies Fossils and\nancient artifacts.
Those thugs sure were bold...\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's almost as if they believe they are\ndoing the right thing.
Perhaps there is a Pokémon that came\nfrom space along with this meteorite.
What in the world could Team Plasma\nbe thinking?!
This is a skeletal specimen from a\nPokémon that flew around the world.
Part of the skeleton was stolen by\nTeam Plasma and is missing!
It's a Fossil of a Pokémon that was\nprotected by a very hard shell.
A meteor that has a space virus\nattached to it.
An ancient round stone that was buried\nin the desert.
A plate with an unknown script carved\ninto it.
A mask that ancient people used to wear\nat festivals.
Bones that were once carried as weapons\nby a certain kind of Pokémon.
