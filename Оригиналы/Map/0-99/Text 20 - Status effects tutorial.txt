Cheren: When a Pokémon is poisoned,\nits HP decreases while it is battling.\xF000븁\x0000
Hey, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xF000븁\x0000\nHave you come looking for the\nGym Leader?
He was here talking about Pokémon\ntypes until just a few moments ago...\xF000븁\x0000\nMaybe you walked right past him?\xF000븁\x0000
Nothing improves your skill as a Trainer\nlike real battles.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's why challenging Gym Leaders is\ngreat practice.\xF000븁\x0000
By the way, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, will you have a\nbattle with me?\xF000븁\x0000\nI want to test how important items are\nin battles.
Cheren: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, will you have a\nbattle with me?\xF000븁\x0000\nI want to test how important items are\nin battles.
Really? I really want to try out my\nitems, so I'll just wait here until you\xF000븀\x0000\ndecide you're ready.
Cheren: Well, let's see how effective\nmy items are...\xF000븁\x0000\nOr maybe I should test how well I can\nbattle without items...?\xF000븁\x0000\nAnyway, this is an indoor match, so let's\nbattle without getting too rough!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: So learning to use items well is\ndefinitely important, then.\xF000븁\x0000\nOh, here. \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, I'll give you\nthese Berries.\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: If you give a Pokémon this kind\nof Berry to hold, it will eat it to heal up\xF000븀\x0000\nwhen its HP goes down in battle.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut if you give Pokémon man-made items\nlike Potions to hold, they can't\xF000븀\x0000\nuse them.\xF000븁\x0000\nWell, good luck, then.\xF000븁\x0000
This Trainers' School exists to meet the\ndemands of Trainers who want to know\xF000븀\x0000\nmore about Pokémon because they\xF000븀\x0000\nlove them!
Pokémon have mysterious powers\ncalled Abilities.\xF000븁\x0000\nAbilities have a variety of effects, and\nmany of those effects are activated when\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon are in battle!
There is a technique that lets you\ncancel evolution!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll read the book about it to you.\nAre you ready?\xF000븁\x0000\n“You can surprise a Pokémon and stop its\nevolution by pressing the B Button when\xF000븀\x0000\na Pokémon is evolving."
Some moves can only be taught with TMs.\xF000븁\x0000\nTMs can be used over and over, so you\nmight want to use them a lot.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you don't like the move you taught,\nyou can always use a different TM.
