Aren't Pokémon great?\xF000븁\x0000\nEven if they're fightin' someone\nbigger than them, up and at 'em they go!
Hahaha!\nStrength is not in the size of a body.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's in the size of the heart!
It is small compared to a luxury liner,\nbut the size of a ship doesn't change the\xF000븀\x0000\nfeeling of adventure when you're out on\xF000븀\x0000\nthe open sea.\xF000븁\x0000
Oh! You have a Liberty Pass.\xF000븁\x0000\nWould you like to go to Liberty Garden?
Your timing is perfect.\nThe ship is about to leave.\xF000븀\x0000\nPlease get aboard ship and wait.\xF000븁\x0000
If you'd like to go to Liberty Garden,\nplease let me know.\xF000븁\x0000
Would you like to go to Liberty Garden?
