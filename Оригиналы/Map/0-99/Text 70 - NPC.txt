Nimbasa City rocks!\xF000븁\x0000\nThere was a guy who gave me an HM\ncalled Strength. For free!\xF000븁\x0000\nHe's somewhere near this Pokémon\nCenter, so why don't you go look for him?
My beauteous Minccino!\nI met it on Route 5.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm pretty sure it will be popular\nin musicals!
Chulululucha!
