So like I said, I'm Fennel, and as you can\nsee, I'm a scientist.\xF000븁\x0000\nIn fact, the subject I'm researching\nis Trainers!\xF000븁\x0000\nProfessor Juniper is my friend\nfrom college.\xF000븁\x0000\nShe asked me to help you guys.\xF000븁\x0000
So!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll give you something to help you.\nThis is a Hidden Machine for you!\xF000븁\x0000



There are some moves that a Pokémon can\nuse even when it is not fighting!\xF000븁\x0000\nWith this Hidden Machine, you can teach\nyour Pokémon a move called Cut.\xF000븀\x0000\nIt can cut down a small tree.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd you can use the Hidden Machine as\nmany times as you want, like a TM.\xF000븀\x0000\nIsn't that great?\xF000븁\x0000\nBut it's difficult to make a Pokémon\nforget a hidden move once it learns it.\xF000븁\x0000
And I'd like to ask you a favor, too!\xF000븁\x0000\nThere is a place called the Dreamyard\non the outskirts of Striaton City.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'd like some of the Dream Mist that a\nPokémon there called Munna gives off.\xF000븁\x0000\nWith that, I'll be able to use\n\xF000\xFF00\x0001\x0002Game Sync \xF000\xFF00\x0001\x0000to collect save files of\xF000븀\x0000\nvarious Trainers!
Fennel: Did Juniper ask you to complete\nthe Pokédex?\xF000븁\x0000\nIt is a challenge to update the Pokédex\nregularly, isn't it?\xF000븁\x0000\nOops! I got distracted! Please bring me\nsome of the Dream Mist that Munna\xF000븀\x0000\ngives off in the Dreamyard!
Fennel: Ta-da!\xF000븁\x0000\nThanks to you, I got some Dream Mist,\nand now I can collect save files of\xF000븀\x0000\nvarious Trainers!\xF000븀\x0000\nThank you very much!\xF000븁\x0000\nAs a token of my appreciation,\nI will give you this C-Gear to use!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe C-Gear is a device related to\ncommunications, such as\xF000븀\x0000\nInfrared Connection or\xF000븀\x0000\nNintendo Wi-Fi Connection.\xF000븁\x0000

About \xF000\xFF00\x0001\x0002Game Sync\xF000\xFF00\x0001\x0000...\xF000븁\x0000\nI'd like to explain a little more about the\nsystem to collect Trainers' save files.\xF000븁\x0000\nDo you have time to learn more?
I am sorry!\nI am so happy, so I will explain about it!\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause, thanks to you, we can do a\ngreat thing!\xF000븁\x0000
