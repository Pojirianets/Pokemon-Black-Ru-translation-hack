Welcome to the Striaton City\nPokémon Gym.\xF000븁\x0000

I'm Chili! I light things up with\nFire-type Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
I'm a Water-type specialist,\nand my name is Cress.\xF000븀\x0000\nPleased to make your acquaintance.\xF000븁\x0000
And my name is Cilan.\nI like Grass-type Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000
Cilan: Um, you see...\xF000븁\x0000\nAs for why the three of us, um,\nare all here is, well, er...\xF000븁\x0000
Chili: Oh, enough! Listen up!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe three of us will\ndecide whom you'll battle!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt'll be based on the type of\nthe first Pokémon you chose!\xF000븁\x0000
Cress: That is indeed the case.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd the partner you first chose was\n\xF000ă\x0001\x0000 type, it seems.\xF000븁\x0000
Ta-da! The Fire-type scorcher Chili--\nthat's me--will be your opponent!\xF000븁\x0000
That is correct!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt shall be I and my esteemed Water\ntypes that you must face in battle!\xF000븁\x0000
Nothing personal... No hard feelings...\nMe and my Grass-type Pokémon will...um...\xF000븀\x0000\nWe're gonna battle, come what may.\xF000븁\x0000
Yeeeeooow!\xF000븁\x0000\nTime to play with FIRE!!\nI'm the strongest of us brothers!\xF000븁\x0000
What incredible luck for you--you get to\nbattle the best among the three of us.\xF000븁\x0000
So, um, if you're OK with me, I'll, um,\nput everything I've got into being, er,\xF000븀\x0000\nyou know, your opponent.\xF000븁\x0000
Aww, man!\nI was all fired up, too!
How exceedingly lucky for you\nthat you do not have to face me.
...Uh hm. I always seem to lose\nthe timing of...of the dance. Like that.\xF000븁\x0000\nTrue enough, I did want to...\nwant to have a Pokémon battle with you.
Whoa ho! You're on fire!\xF000븁\x0000\nWell, it's the Pokémon League's rule.\nTake this Gym Badge!\xF000븁\x0000
Why, you're quite remarkable.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's the Pokémon League's rule, so--\nplease take this Badge.\xF000븁\x0000
...What a surprise.\nYou...are very strong.\xF000븁\x0000\nSeems like not even\nChili or Cress could beat you...\xF000븁\x0000
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 received\nthe Trio Badge from Chili!\xF000븁\x0000
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 received\nthe Trio Badge from Cress!\xF000븁\x0000
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 received\nthe Trio Badge from Cilan!\xF000븁\x0000
Gym Badges are proof\nof a Trainer's abilities.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you have one Badge, Pokémon, including\ntraded Pokémon up to Lv. 20,\xF000븀\x0000\nwill obey you without question.\xF000븁\x0000\nWe also want you to have this.\xF000븁\x0000
\xF000ĉ\x0001\x0000 contains Work Up.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you use Work Up, the Pokémon's\nAttack and Sp. Atk go up!\xF000븁\x0000\nBy the way, TMs can be used\nas many times as you want.
In the Unova region, we are still\nnovice Gym Leaders.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhich means the other Gym Leaders\nare much stronger than we are.\xF000븀\x0000\nWe'll need to work hard and improve.
I can't believe TMs can be used\nover and over!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you wanted, you could use one to\nteach all your Pokémon the same move!
If there were 17 siblings in\nthe Striaton City Gym...\xF000븁\x0000\nThere could be a specialist for\neach type of Pokémon.
Cilan: In the Unova region, um,\nwe are still novice Gym Leaders.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhich means, well, that other Gym\nLeaders are much stronger than we are.\xF000븁\x0000\nGoing...slow...and steady...is OK, so...\nwe compete with one another\xF000븀\x0000\nand get, um, stronger and stronger.
Chili: Oh! It's you!\xF000븁\x0000\nYour fire is more intense than\nwhen you got the Trio Badge!
Cress: ...We heard about\nthe incident with N's Castle.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf we had received the message in time,\nthe three of us could have helped.
Hello! I'm Clyde. I'm the guide for\nTrainers challenging a Pokémon Gym.\xF000븁\x0000\nWe appreciate your challenging the Gym.\nTake this to commemorate the occasion.\xF000븁\x0000
One basic element of Pokémon battles is\nthe relationship between types.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you choose Pokémon with effective\ntypes and effective moves,\xF000븀\x0000\nvictory is just a step away!\xF000븁\x0000\nIn this Gym, you proceed by\nstepping on the switch with\xF000븀\x0000\nthe type that is effective against the\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon type shown on the curtain.
I hope you'll always remember the\nincredible moment when you received\xF000븀\x0000\nthis Gym Badge.
Welcome!\xF000븁\x0000\nWe are very proud of our menu,\nwhich we adjust to suit each Trainer!
