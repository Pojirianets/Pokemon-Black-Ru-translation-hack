Pansage, Pansear, and Panpour are\nPokémon that evolve with special stones!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhich Pokémon do you want to evolve?
Pansage...\nThen, it's a Leaf Stone you need.\xF000븁\x0000
Pansear...\nThen, it's a Fire Stone you need.\xF000븁\x0000
Panpour...\nThen, it's a Water Stone you need.\xF000븁\x0000
You might already know this, but I will\ngive you some advice!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen a Pokémon evolves, it will be more\npowerful, but it will be slower to learn\xF000븀\x0000\na new move.\xF000븁\x0000\nThis is especially true for Pokémon that\nevolve with stones.\xF000븁\x0000\nSo, it's up to you: you can have it learn\na good move and then evolve it with\xF000븀\x0000\na stone, or evolve it with a stone fast\xF000븀\x0000\nand then have it learn a move with a TM!

Yes, that's true.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's difficult to choose one.\nWhen you decide, let me know!
Stick up your thumbs, and curl in\nyour fingers.\xF000븁\x0000\nThis is a thumbs-up pose. That means OK!\nIn some places, it also means money!
