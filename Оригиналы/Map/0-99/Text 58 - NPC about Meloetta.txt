A beautiful melody makes people happy.\nA sad melody makes people sorrowful...\xF000븀\x0000\nThat's the power of melodies...
The scent you brought me reminded me of\na long-ago melody from the fringes of my\xF000븀\x0000\nsepia-toned memories.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt was a song my mother loved...\nIt makes me feel so nostalgic.\xF000븁\x0000\nWould you like to hear the melody?\xF000븁\x0000
My mother once told me of a Pokémon that\nplayed a melody and danced so lightly\xF000븀\x0000\nthat it filled people's hearts with joy.\xF000븁\x0000\nThen sorrow darkened the entire world,\nand the Pokémon lost the melody...\xF000븁\x0000\nAlso, at that time, some red shoes\nwere lost somewhere...\xF000븁\x0000
When you came through the door,\nI remembered the melody!\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd the Pokémon that had forgotten how\nto dance began to step lightly once more!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou are the inspiration.\nYou are a mysterious child...
Let it sing the Relic Song.\xF000븁\x0000\nAria Forme will become Pirouette Forme,\nand vice versa.
\xF000Ă\x0001\x0000 remembered\nthe Relic Song it had forgotten!\xF000븁\x0000


This is your first visit to this café.\nAm I correct?\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease...\xF000븁\x0000
Give this to your dear Pokémon.
You came all the way here.\nEnjoy...
After a tiring day of work, this café is a\nperfect spot to let your mind relax.
When I listen to his guitar, it reminds me\nof leaving home for the first time, and\xF000븀\x0000\nthe tears of farewell my mother cried...
