Bianca: Heeey, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou remember the promise you\nmade on the Xtransceiver, right?\xF000븁\x0000\nSo, let's get right to our\nPokémon battle!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Hello, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou remember the promise you\nmade on the Xtransceiver, right?\xF000븁\x0000\nSo, let's get right to our\nPokémon battle!\xF000븁\x0000
But, before that...\xF000븁\x0000
They said we can have a Pokémon battle\nin the gate as long as we're careful not\xF000븀\x0000\nto break the electric bulletin board.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm the new-and-improved version of me!\nIt's gonna go great this time!\xF000븁\x0000\nLet's start up our Pokémon battle again!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: I'll never be a strong Trainer\nlike you or Cheren or Iris, but...\xF000븁\x0000\nYou know, since we left Nuvema Town,\nI've met a lot of people and I've been\xF000븀\x0000\nthinking about what I want to do in life!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen you look at it that way, Pokémon\nhave given me a lot of new experiences.\xF000븁\x0000
Having my Pokémon stolen was just\nreally hard, and I felt really unsure...\xF000븁\x0000\nStill, I gotta say I'm really glad I went!\xF000븁\x0000\nI've learned so much on this journey.\nAnd I also learned that being with\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon is really, really important!\xF000븁\x0000\nOK, well, I hope to see you again soon!\nBye-bye, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000
Maybe I should try to find a\nPokémon on Route 4 to catch!
Route 4 is long!\nBe careful if you plan to follow it!
Nimbasa City is at the end\nof Route 4.
