\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 received the\nBolt Badge from Elesa!\xF000븁\x0000
If you have four Badges, including this\nBolt Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 50,\xF000븀\x0000\nincluding traded Pokémon, will obey you.\xF000븁\x0000\nAlso, here's this move I like.\nFeel free to use it, um, if you want to.\xF000븁\x0000
Volt Switch lets the Pokémon switch with\na different Pokémon after attacking.\xF000븁\x0000\nOf course, if you don't have another\nPokémon in your party, you can't switch.\xF000븁\x0000
You're going to Driftveil City next?\xF000븁\x0000\nOf course. There is a Pokémon Gym there,\nafter all. Oh...\xF000븁\x0000\nI bet you won't be able to get there.\nYou know what?\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll fix it so you can cross.\nWait for me on Route 5.
What you'd like to do...\nWhat your Pokémon would like to do...\xF000븁\x0000\nDon't you think it could be amazing\nif those are aligned?
Elesa: I think the real me is the one who\nbattles with Pokémon as a Gym Leader.\xF000븁\x0000\nA model's job is to make someone else's\nvision look like a reality.\xF000븀\x0000\nIt's interesting, but it's not easy...
Are you cool riding a roller coaster?\xF000븁\x0000
When you ride a roller coaster, the\nspeed can make you dizzy.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm going to make your head spin with\na Pokémon battle that's just as intense!\xF000븁\x0000
Your way of battling...\nIt's elegant! You've got style!\xF000븀\x0000\nEven compared to Ms. Elesa!\xF000븁\x0000
If you press the switches, the\nroller coaster's path will change.

I'm also a Pokémon Trainer who was\ntoughened up by Ms. Elesa.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll show you power and style befitting\nthis Gym.\xF000븁\x0000
It pleases me to be the opponent of a\nstrong and honorable Trainer like you!\xF000븁\x0000
If you maintain your calm and don't get\nflustered by this Gym's gimmicks,\xF000븀\x0000\nyou'll be able to defeat Ms. Elesa...\xF000븀\x0000\nand any other Trainer, as well!
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 pressed the switch.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe roller coaster's path\nhas been changed!
How about it? I can see you're surprised!\xF000븁\x0000\nWould you ever have guessed that\nthis Gym is a roller coaster?\xF000븁\x0000\nOK, let me fill you in...\nAnd take this, too!\xF000븁\x0000
In this roller coaster Gym, the first\nstep is to get in the car.\xF000븁\x0000\nNext comes the platform!\nThere, you can change\xF000븀\x0000\nwhere the coaster is going!\xF000븁\x0000\nSometimes you continue by riding\nthe cars of opponents you defeat.\xF000븀\x0000\nThat's how you aim for the Gym Leader!\xF000븁\x0000\nBy the way, Electric-type Pokémon don't\ndo well against Ground-type moves...
Elesa uses sparkling bright\nElectric-type attacks!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut the combination of you and your\nPokémon was even more impressive!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt was... It was...\nan emotional roller coaster!
