Cheren: Hey, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000.\nI just challenged the Gym Leader Burgh.\xF000븁\x0000
He's a seasoned Gym Leader.\nHe made me work for that Gym Badge!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut for me, Bug-type Pokémon\naren't much of a challenge.\xF000븁\x0000
I'm going to keep winning like this against\nall of the Unova region's Gym Leaders!\xF000븁\x0000\nThen, I'll head for the Pokémon League\nand outperform the Champion!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf I do that, everyone will admit\nwhat a strong Trainer I am...\xF000븁\x0000\nThat will make me feel truly alive...\xF000븁\x0000
Burgh: Ah hah!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou're the one who fought\nTeam Plasma in Pinwheel Forest...\xF000븁\x0000\nIf I remember, your name is...\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000\nCome to challenge the Gym, I suppose?\xF000븁\x0000
Burgh: Ah hah!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou're the one who fought\nTeam Plasma in Pinwheel Forest...\xF000븁\x0000\nIf I remember, your name is...\xF000븁\x0000\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000\nCome to challenge the Gym, I suppose?\xF000븁\x0000
Aww. Sorry, but could you wait a bit?\xF000븁\x0000\nI was informed that Team Plasma\nhas shown up!\xF000븁\x0000\nIn fact... Come with me!\nI'm going to the dock at Prime Pier!\xF000븁\x0000
Burgh: This is definitely the place.\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: No one's here! Not a soul!\xF000븁\x0000\nNo other Team Plasma members, nor any\nof the Seven Sages, are inside.\xF000븁\x0000\n...If you think I'm lying, why don't\nwe have a little battle and find out?
Team Plasma: Don't scare me like that.\nCome on!\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: I...had a thought!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll take care of this weak-looking runt,\nso you can show off by handling\xF000븀\x0000\nthat tough-looking guy over there!\xF000븁\x0000
Think about how a Pokémon feels when\nit's being used by a pathetic Trainer!
What's your problem with\ntaking people's Pokémon?!
Burgh: Oh, please!\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, I'll leave that one to you!\xF000븁\x0000
Burgh: Oh, please!\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, I'll leave that one to you!\xF000븁\x0000
Burgh: Looks like our only\noption is to battle them and go on in.
Team Plasma: This is bad...\xF000븁\x0000\nBadbadbadbadbadbadbad!\xF000븁\x0000\nBad for Team Plasma!\nOr Plasbad, for short!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's in my best interest to go\nreport to the Seven Sages right now!\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: Phew, we got lost.\xF000븁\x0000\nEven with directions from the\nXtransceiver, I couldn't figure it out!\xF000븁\x0000
Burgh: Team Plasma is inside.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe stolen Pokémon may be in\nthere as well.\xF000븀\x0000\nOK, I'm going in!\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: OK! This time, I'll join the fight!\xF000븁\x0000\nCome on, Bianca. You, too!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: W-wait!\xF000븁\x0000\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000! You come, too!\xF000븁\x0000
The Xtransceiver is ringing.
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 picked up the Xtransceiver.\xF000븁\x0000
What Gym Leaders test is the strength\nof the bond between the challenger\xF000븀\x0000\nand his or her Pokémon!
Before challenging the Gym, you'll want\nto be sure you have enough Potions.
Being a Pokémon Trainer doesn't\nnecessarily make someone stronger.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut everyone can love their Pokémon\nand enjoy playing together.
I have six Poké Balls in my Bag!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut, really, what I want is\nGreat Balls and Ultra Balls!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou can't buy them at the Poké Mart\nuntil you've collected Badges, though.
My Pokémon is soooo cute!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt always makes me feel better\nwhen I come home!
