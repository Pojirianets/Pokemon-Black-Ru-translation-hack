My name is Mr. Lock.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm a magical clown who can\nopen anything.\xF000븁\x0000\nYour name is \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000.\nI'll see you again, I'm sure.
You have a Lock Capsule in your Bag...\xF000븁\x0000\nI am the only one in the whole world\nwho can open the capsule.\xF000븁\x0000\nI can open it in the blink of an eye!\xF000븁\x0000
Look! As you can see, I opened it swiftly\nand with precision!\xF000븁\x0000\nInside the capsule...\nWhat your heart most desires...\xF000븀\x0000\na Technical Machine!\xF000븁\x0000
Hm. There's a letter with the\nTechnical Machine...\xF000븁\x0000
“I entrust the Technical Machine in the\nLock Capsule to a trustworthy Trainer in\xF000븀\x0000\nthe Unova region.\xF000븁\x0000\nDon't allow it to fall into the hands of\nvillains like Team Rocket..."\xF000븁\x0000
More is written here...\xF000븁\x0000\n“TM95 is Snarl.\nIt's a Dark-type Special Attack, and\xF000븀\x0000\nit lowers the opponents' Sp. Atk stat."\xF000븁\x0000\nSo that's what it is...a move that tests\nthe sense of the user!
Even though I opened the Lock Capsule,\nI can't unlock a closed heart.\xF000븁\x0000\nI am a sad clown, indeed...
I secretly invented a special machine.\xF000븁\x0000\nOnly people who know the secret\npassword can use it.\xF000븁\x0000
There's more!\xF000븁\x0000
This is the password that will enable you\nto use the Relocator I invented!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's a superb machine that will swiftly\nfetch a special Pokémon or item\xF000븀\x0000\nby connecting to a special network.
I added a button on the main menu.\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease save the game, then go back to\nthe title screen!
Unfortunately, it seems that you don't\nremember the password...
Did you find my Relocator useful?
