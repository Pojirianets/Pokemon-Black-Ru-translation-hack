Oh! Trainer!\nDo you have enough Poké Balls?\xF000븁\x0000\nDon't be shy.\nTake this with you!\xF000븁\x0000
You cannot have too many Poké Balls!\xF000븁\x0000\nMy advice is that when you use a better\nPoké Ball, it's easier to catch Pokémon!
The beginning of my relationship with\nmy wife was our Pokémon battles.\xF000븁\x0000\nI could not defeat her, even\nthough I tried many times!
My husband and I are compatible...\nbecause he cannot beat me in battle!
