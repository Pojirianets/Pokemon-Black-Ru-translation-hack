When I answered a questionnaire earlier,\nI got a questionnaire sheet.\xF000븁\x0000\nMaybe I will answer all the\nquestionnaires...
After the questionnaire, the next step is\nconducting a survey.\xF000븁\x0000\nSet the request you want to survey\non the Survey Radar...\xF000븀\x0000\nAnd let's go!
New statisticians are not\nanswering questionnaires.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf they answered questionnaires,\nthey could conduct more surveys...\xF000븀\x0000\nWhat a shame!
Hello, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0001!\xF000븁\x0000\nI've also started teaching novice\nstatisticians how to conduct surveys.
What is the popular movie now?\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0001, do you have any idea?
What is the popular food now?\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0001, do you have any idea?
What is the popular...\nOh, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0001.\xF000븁\x0000\nI knew it.\nI have to take a survey by myself...\xF000븁\x0000\nAh, it is a pain in the neck...
The survey requests from the leader\nare hard. Don't you agree?\xF000븁\x0000\nBesides, the number of more difficult\nsurveys are increasing...
