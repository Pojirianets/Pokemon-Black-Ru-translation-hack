Professor Juniper: Hello, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Come here.\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: Elesa called and was\nasking me all about Electric-type\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon, and I thought about you guys.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's why I wanted to see you.\nTa-da! Freebies for you!\xF000븁\x0000
Here, Cheren!\xF000븁\x0000
You, too, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xF000븁\x0000
If you see a Pokémon that\nyou want to have join you,\xF000븀\x0000\nbe sure to use a good type of Poké Ball.\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause this could be the\nfirst and last time you see that Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
I know it might seem strange for me\nto say this, since I'm the one who asked\xF000븀\x0000\nyou to complete the Pokédex, but please,\xF000븀\x0000\nremember to enjoy your journey!\xF000븁\x0000
Of course, I'm not saying you can just\nneglect the Pokédex. But you know that!\xF000븁\x0000\nNow, if you'll please excuse me,\nI have to go meet Bianca.\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: It seems the Professor\ngave us the Pokédex as a reason\xF000븀\x0000\nto send us on a journey.\xF000븁\x0000\nAt least, that's what my mom told me.\xF000븁\x0000\nThey wanted us to go out and see the\nworld, so my mom, Bianca's mom, and your\xF000븀\x0000\nmom made a request to Professor Juniper.\xF000븁\x0000
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, what should we do now?\xF000븁\x0000\nI think I'd like to show the professor my\nthanks by going to Route 4 and catching\xF000븀\x0000\nsome Pokémon I haven't yet caught.\xF000븁\x0000
If you've come from Route 4,\nNimbasa City is ahead.\xF000븁\x0000\nNext! If you've come from Nimbasa City,\nRoute 4 is ahead!
Look at the electric bulletin board to\nsee what's happening in Nimbasa City!
