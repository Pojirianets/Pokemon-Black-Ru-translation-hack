When work's finally over...\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen my thrown Poké Ball rocks three\ntimes and I hear that great “click"...\xF000븁\x0000\nMy life is full of things that give me joy!
I'm a battling Clerk ⑭!\n...But my Pokémon are weak.
Busy, busy!\xF000븁\x0000\nAfter I eat breakfast, I have to think\nabout lunch.\xF000븁\x0000\nAfter eating lunch, I worry about dinner.\nEvery day's the same. What a busy life!
Hey there, Trainer!\nAre your Pokémon healthy?\xF000븁\x0000\nBeing healthy's the best, because when\nyou're healthy, you can do anything!
...Grumble, grumble, grumble.\xF000븁\x0000\nShould I change my Pokémon's moves,\nor should I change my Pokémon?\xF000븁\x0000\nGrumble, grumble...
Castelia City has so many people!\xF000븁\x0000\nSometimes there are people who are only\ninterested in themselves.
My favorite way to spend my lunch break\nis watching ships at the dock.
Working women are beautiful, and\nbattling Pokémon are wonderful!
At the Battle Company, we welcome\nTrainers who are proud of their skills.
Next time, I'll do it! Next time, I want to\neat a Casteliacone for sure!
