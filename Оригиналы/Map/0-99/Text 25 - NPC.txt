Hi, Trainer! Do you know a Pokémon\ncalled Audino?\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's a Pokémon that I sometimes find\nwhen I'm walking.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt jumps out of rustling grass.\nI can get a lot of Exp. Points.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's kind of a friendly Pokémon, isn't it?
I heard that the Fossils in the museum\nwere found in Twist Mountain.\xF000븁\x0000\nThen, a person called Clay apparently\ndonated them to the museum.
When you choose “HELP"\nat the PC at a Pokémon Center,\xF000븀\x0000\nyou can learn many things. It's so cool!
