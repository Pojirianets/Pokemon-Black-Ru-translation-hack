I've trained only Fire-type Pokémon,\n'cause they're my favorites!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut they had no chance in a battle\nagainst Water-type Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000\nSigh... Maybe I should try to train\nPokémon of other types.
It is quite hard to train six Pokémon at\nonce, so I've heard some Trainers focus\xF000븀\x0000\non training three Pokémon at a time.
Skreee!
