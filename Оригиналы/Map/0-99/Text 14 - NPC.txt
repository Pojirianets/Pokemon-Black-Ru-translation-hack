Fennel: You're going to meet all of the\nPokémon in the Unova region. Am I right?\xF000븁\x0000\nOh, the stairs are right here!\xF000븁\x0000
Fennel: My room is upstairs here.\nCome on, go upstairs!\xF000븁\x0000
After a battle, to my surprise,\nmy Pokémon evolved and\xF000븀\x0000\nchanged its appearance!
Some evolve and some don't...\xF000븁\x0000\nPokémon really are mysterious creatures.
You can't go upstairs now!\xF000븁\x0000\n'Cause Fennel said she was testing\nsomething, and she had a scary look\xF000븀\x0000\non her face!
She may not look like it,\nbut Fennel is a great scientist!
