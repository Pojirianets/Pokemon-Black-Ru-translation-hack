Thanks again for your help.\xF000븁\x0000\nMy bug Pokémon are scurrying with\nexcitement about getting to battle you.\xF000븁\x0000\nLet's get straight to it!\xF000븁\x0000
Aww...\nI lost.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhatever! Losing to you doesn't bug me\nbecause you are a-MAZ-ingly strong!\xF000븁\x0000\nThis is the Gym Badge!\nYou beat me, so it's yours!\xF000븁\x0000
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 received the\nInsect Badge from Burgh.\xF000븁\x0000
It's the Insect Badge!\nIt's insectible--I mean, incredible!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you have three Badges,\nPokémon up to Lv. 40 will obey you,\xF000븀\x0000\nincluding traded Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause I'm a generous guy,\nI'll also give you this.\xF000븁\x0000
Struggle Bug also lowers the\nSp. Atk of the target that was damaged.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm the best guy to tell you,\nit's the little things that count!
How many discoveries have you made\nsince you started your adventure?\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen I was a kid, my innocent heart was\ncaptured by the beauty of bug Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nI drew with them and battled with them,\nand after all this time, I continue\xF000븀\x0000\nto discover new things.\xF000븁\x0000\nA world shared with Pokémon is a world\nswarming with mysteries.
Burgh: Heya!\nThis is what I do.\xF000븁\x0000\nI keep raising Pokémon and drawing\npictures inspired by the Pokémon I raise.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's what I love to do. My life hums\nwith energy. What could be better?
When you step on the switch,\nthe one that pops out is--moi!\xF000븁\x0000\nOn that note, have a battle with moi!\xF000븁\x0000
Hiding makes battle instincts dull,\nyou know.
Now. Come. On.\xF000븁\x0000\nStep on this switch, and what happens?\nMoi!
Yeeeeeeeeah! Thank you for going\nto the trouble of calling me out!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll channel my gratitude into my\nPokémon's moves and...\xF000븀\x0000\nmake sure it gets to you!\xF000븁\x0000
If you hadn't stepped on that switch,\nI'd still be stuck hidden away.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's right! Bug Gym Trainers like to\nbe bugged!
Hiding beneath the floor, I understand\nhow a Bug-type Pokémon feels.
What do you think of Castelia City?\xF000븁\x0000\nI bet, with all of the bustling people,\nyou started feeling worn down on your\xF000븀\x0000\nway to the Gym!\xF000븁\x0000\nNever mind! This will help. Take it!\xF000븁\x0000
The theme of this Gym is\nwalking through walls.\xF000븁\x0000\nAt first glance, these funny honey walls\nmay look impassable or even impossible.\xF000븀\x0000\nIf you try hard, it'll work out. So I say.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut...if it doesn't, here's a sweet tip:\nstep on the switches on the floor!
Wow! That's amazing!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou swatted aside our Gym Leader\nBurgh's tricky attacks...\xF000븁\x0000\nI can barely imagine how much\nstronger you're going to get!
The Gym Leader said he was going to\nPrime Pier and left for a little bit.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou're welcome to go track him down.
