Ghetsis: My word, if it isn't\nthe Gym Leader, Burgh.\xF000븁\x0000
Burgh: So, what would you say is the\nguiding principle of Team Plasma, anyway?\xF000븁\x0000\n“Take what you want from people"?\xF000븁\x0000
Bronius: I thought it would be amusing\nto prepare a hideout right in front of a\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon Gym, but we were detected\xF000븀\x0000\nmore quickly than I imagined.\xF000븁\x0000
Ghetsis: Indeed...\xF000븁\x0000\nNo matter. We already have an\nexceptional base of operations.\xF000븁\x0000\nIs everyone familiar with the legend\nof the founding of the Unova region?\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: I am! It's the white\nDragon-type Pokémon, right?\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: I am! It's the black\nDragon-type Pokémon, right?\xF000븁\x0000
Ghetsis: The truth is this...\xF000븁\x0000\nThe white dragon appeared before a hero\nwho sought the true way to knit together\xF000븀\x0000\na world full of many warring people.\xF000븁\x0000\nThis white Dragon-type Pokémon shared\nits knowledge--and bared its fangs\xF000븀\x0000\nat those who stood against it.\xF000븁\x0000\nTogether, the power of this Pokémon and\nthe hero brought unity to the hearts of\xF000븀\x0000\neveryone in the land,\xF000븀\x0000\nand that is how Unova was created.\xF000븁\x0000
Ghetsis: The truth is this...\xF000븁\x0000\nThe black dragon appeared before a hero\nwho sought the ideal way to knit\xF000븀\x0000\ntogether a world full of warring people.\xF000븁\x0000\nThis black Dragon-type Pokémon shared\nits knowledge--and bared its fangs\xF000븀\x0000\nat those who stood against it.\xF000븁\x0000\nTogether, the power of this Pokémon and\nthe hero brought unity to the hearts of\xF000븀\x0000\neveryone in the land,\xF000븀\x0000\nand that is how Unova was created.\xF000븁\x0000
We shall bring back the hero and\nthat Pokémon to Unova once again!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf we can win people's hearts and minds,\nwe can easily create the world that\xF000븀\x0000\nI--I mean, Team Plasma--desires!\xF000븁\x0000
Burgh: Here in Castelia, we have\na lot of different kinds of people.\xF000븁\x0000\nEveryone's ways of thinking and\nlifestyles are very different.\xF000븁\x0000\nHonestly, there's something about what\nyou're saying I don't quite understand.
Yes?
What is it?
Burgh: One thing we all have in\ncommon is that we all care a lot\xF000븀\x0000\nabout Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nEven people meeting for the first time\ncan talk about Pokémon.\xF000븀\x0000\nTalk or battle or trade...\xF000븁\x0000
Remember your speech at Accumula Town?\xF000븁\x0000\nYou were responsible for leading me to\nrethink my relationship with Pokémon.\xF000븀\x0000\nFor that, I thank you.\xF000븁\x0000\nAt that time, I made a promise...\xF000븁\x0000\nI swore to myself that I would dedicate\nmyself to Pokémon even more strongly!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat you guys are doing... Aren't you\ngoing to strengthen the bond between\xF000븀\x0000\npeople and Pokémon even more?\xF000븁\x0000
Ghetsis: Myah-ha-ha-ha!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou are quite hard to figure out--a little\nmore intelligent than I'd expected.\xF000븁\x0000\nI am fond of intelligent people, you see.\nYou'll enjoy hearing about this...\xF000븁\x0000\nFrom every corner of the world,\nI have gathered knowledgeable people\xF000븀\x0000\nfor our king's benefit.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou could call them the Seven Sages.\xF000븁\x0000\nVery well! We will submit to your\nopinion and be on our way.\xF000븁\x0000
That girl over there...\nReturn her Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Th-thank you!\xF000븁\x0000\nMunny, I'm so glad to see you again!\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: Bianca!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhy are you thanking them?\nThey take people's precious Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: It's just... I'm...I'm so happy\nthat my Munna is safe.\xF000븁\x0000
Ghetsis: The friendship between Pokémon\nand people can be very touching.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut, in order to liberate Pokémon from\nfoolish people, we will revive the legend\xF000븀\x0000\nof Unova--and win the hearts and minds\xF000븀\x0000\nof everyone. Farewell...\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: What are you doing?\nWhy are you letting them get away?!\xF000븁\x0000
Burgh: Gah!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat do we do if anything's happened\nto the other stolen Pokémon?\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: It's OK. Thank you, Iris!\xF000븁\x0000\nNo one was hurt. More than anything,\nI got my darling Pokémon back again!\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: OK, if you're happy...\xF000븁\x0000
Burgh: What is everyone\nplanning to do now?\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Oh, it would be sensational to\nlook around Castelia City, but...\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: Don't worry!\nI'll keep on being your bodyguard!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Iris...\xF000븁\x0000
Burgh: Uh-hm. That's great!\xF000븁\x0000\nIris is a dazzling Pokémon Trainer,\nbut maybe not at home in the\xF000븀\x0000\nbig city yet.\xF000븁\x0000\nSo, a little give-and-take, hm! People and\nPokémon need to help each other out!\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: Also, thanks for looking\nfor the Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nHere, this is for you!\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: Also, thanks for looking\nfor the Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nHere, this is for you!\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: See you!\xF000븁\x0000
Wha...
Waaait!
Burgh: Well, then, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000.\nI'll be waiting in the Gym.\xF000븁\x0000
