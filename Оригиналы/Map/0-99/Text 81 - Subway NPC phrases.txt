The challenge was interrupted.
The selection was canceled.
Constant battles make me nervous.\nI'm taking a little rest here.
I'm going to save up Battle Points and\nget some items for my Pokémon to hold.
For each seven-win streak, the Trainers\nand Pokémon who challenge you become\xF000븀\x0000\nprogressively tougher.
I've decided to use only cute Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nDo you have any unique thing you're\nparticular about?
OK! I'm all prepared!\nAll aboard for a battle journey!
Phew...I'm worn out.\xF000븁\x0000\nThese Trainers are tough. I wonder\nhow far I'll get with my skills.
Have you heard of the Subway Bosses?\xF000븁\x0000\nThey appear only to strong Trainers,\nand they challenge them to battles.\xF000븁\x0000\nThey are the Battle Subway's bosses.
That last battle was tough...\xF000븁\x0000\nI should've traded in my BP for a\nbetter item.
If you have wooon, the trip goes ooon!\nRelying on Pokémon, this vagabooond!
About time to take it to the next level.\nGive it your best shot, too!
The Trainers here are really tough\nfrom the very start.
My 42nd straight win...\nNot too shabby, eh?
Can't believe I won 84 straight...\nIs this a dream or a hallucination?
You've got a 14-win streak!\nPretty good! Not bad!
I hear the Super Train is endless!\xF000븁\x0000\nIn other words, if you keep winning, you\ncan keep going, on and on to wherever!
I can go a lot further!\nI can win a lot more!
The eyes of the Trainers here are very\nserious, or maybe you could say glinting.
Is this the best this officer can do...?\xF000븁\x0000\nThe light from the passing trains seems\nway too bright.
The Subway Boss was a suspicious,\nstrange fellow.\xF000븁\x0000\nI still don't believe he was giving it\nhis all.
Challenging people is also part of my\npolice training.
I can legally go as wild as I want!\nThis place! It's paradise, isn't it?
My journey has just started!\nNeither of us can afford to lose!
Being alone on the station's platform\nsomehow makes me feel a little sad.\xF000븁\x0000\nPeople leave on their journeys here, and\nit reminds me of those memories.
The Subway Boss was a piece of cake!\xF000븁\x0000\nMaybe I should cut loose on the\nSuper Train next time!
The Trainers sure have become stronger.\nI'm feeling a little uneasy...
It looks like my Pokémon skill has\nreached its peak power.\xF000븁\x0000\nI couldn't let go of my dreams...\nI'll hang them on you, stranger,\xF000븀\x0000\nyoung Trainer.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd this is proof.\nPlease accept this, youngster...\xF000븁\x0000
I'm going to return to my home and\nquietly cheer myself up with art!
Oh ho ho ho...\xF000븁\x0000\nI've already done better than I did\nduring my last challenge!
Battle between two excellent Trainers is\nvery artistic.
For being called a Subway Boss,\nthat Trainer sure wasn't as strong\xF000븀\x0000\nas “Boss" suggests.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt was almost as if...\xF000븁\x0000\nAs if they are simply gauging\nhow strong we really are.
Well then!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's about time to get on\nthe train!
Now just wait a minute, little Pokémon!\nI'll let you battle lots and lots soon!
Urk!\xF000븁\x0000\nI got motion sickness on the train...
You beat our boss, right?\nNot half bad, hey!\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd now, super Trainer, you've\nearned the qualification to take on the\xF000븀\x0000\nSuper Train!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe Trainers on the Super Train are\nreally tough.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you want to know the essence of the\nBattle Subway, you should give it a try!
I'd rather have an exciting battle than\nslowly drive the train.
Where did you come from?\nAnd where are you going?
We Depot Agents are the protectors of\npeace and order in the station.\xF000븁\x0000\nWe are verrry opposed to littering on\nthe platform, shouting or playing\xF000븀\x0000\ninstruments, loitering, or any activities\xF000븀\x0000\nthat bother other people!
Just like how a machine needs fine-tuning,\nPokémon need maintenance, too.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's a necessity.\xF000븁\x0000\nFor example, rethinking the moves that a\nPokémon knows.
No clumsy gimmicks...\nNo unnecessary items...\xF000븁\x0000\nThe only thing you can rely on is the\nstrength of you and your Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nThis place is wonderful, isn't it?
Over 100 straight victories...\xF000븁\x0000\nIf this is all due to your strength,\nyou're even a match for the Champion.
The strength of the Trainers on\nthe Super Train is beyond imagination!
I had a taste of it...\nThe rush of battle...\xF000븁\x0000\nI shouldn't...\nIt's too wild...\xF000븁\x0000\nBut at this rate, I'm going to\nend up on the path of battlers...
Howdy! I'm a genius Pilot!\nUnova's finest!\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd I'm comin' in first here, too!
I've seen elite Trainers like me\nall over the place, but...\xF000븁\x0000\nSeems like the battles will be tough\nfrom here on.
Even for an elite Trainer such as myself,\nit's starting to get hard.
Hey, how are you doing?\nI'm still going strong!
I've a-done it--77 straight wins!\nThat number has a lucky sound!
We've defeated over 300 Trainers...
My my, what a weak-looking Trainer...\xF000븁\x0000\nI think I would just get bored if I\nbattled you...\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll give you this, so just get a little\ntougher, OK?\xF000븁\x0000
I'm only interested in strong\nopponents...\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you get tougher, I wouldn't\nmind battling you.
Not many people left on the platform...\xF000븁\x0000\nGuess that shows how hard it is\nto keep winning on the Battle Subway.
...\xF000븁\x0000\nHuh? What? What do you want?\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm busy planning my tactics for my\nnext battle.\xF000븁\x0000\nI don't mean to be rude, but I really\nneed to concentrate. Would you mind\xF000븀\x0000\nnot talking to me right now?
91 straight victories is nothing more\nthan a natural result for me.\xF000븁\x0000\nMy glorious record will just keep\ngoing up!
You...\nYou have the same eyes as me.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou love battling so much...\nNo, it's not just that...\xF000븁\x0000\nBattling is your reason for living.\nYou and I are the same type, aren't we?\xF000븁\x0000\nSo...I'll give you this.\xF000븁\x0000
You're continuing your battle, right?\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's because we are that type of\nperson, aren't we...
I'm going to leave a rockin' record and\nturn into a big star!
Hey, how are you doing?\nI'm still going strong!
There's more to Pokémon than it seems.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe world of Pokémon battling really gets\ndeeper and deeper.
I found this when I was cleaning.\nYou can have it if you'd like.\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, no need to thank me!\nAfter all, I just found it in the trash.\xF000븁\x0000\nI don't understand it. Recently, many\nfolks have just been throwing away\xF000븀\x0000\nperfectly good things.
I may be a Janitor, but I have a lot\nof confidence in my abilities!
All right! Bring out your Poké Balls!\nNow is the time for a battle!
You like battles, too!
I can't believe a Veteran like me\nwould get into trouble like that.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhere in the world are the Trainers\nhere training?
How are you doing, Trainer?\nAre you starting to get tired yet?
Mumble, mumble, mumble...\xF000븁\x0000\nIn order to bring good fortune, I always\nthink about my family before a battle.
I've been watching you battle.\xF000븁\x0000\nNice technique and judgment... Not\nsurprising, after a win streak like yours.
Not many people around.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut each person who is still here has\nshown true strength.
Even a Veteran can lose to a Preschooler\nif they get careless.\xF000븁\x0000\nPokémon battling requires that you\nalways be on guard.
Just a little more to 50 straight wins!\nSuddenly, I'm all pumped up!
You have the face of someone who\nabsolutely loves Pokémon battling.\xF000븁\x0000\nEven now, you're still completely hooked\non battling. Amazing.\xF000븁\x0000\nHee hee...\nYou have a promising future!
You and I both have 91 straight wins!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhich of us will reach a 100-win\nstreak first?
Dawn and dusk behind my battles...\xF000븁\x0000\nThe rocking train softly rattles...\xF000븁\x0000\nHow many hours have now passed\nsince we left Nimbasa in the past?
This is the end of the line...\xF000븁\x0000\nThe trip sure ended quickly.\nI don't want to go home yet.
If you've made it this far, that means\nyou've won 14 in a row.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat a fluke! Fourteen is how old I am!\xF000븁\x0000\nHa ha ha...
I'm going to let people know I'm still\nas active as ever!
It's the end of the line already...\xF000븁\x0000\nI guess that means my Pokémon\nbattle journey is over for now.
Phew...\xF000븁\x0000\nThis long journey is hard on this\nold body.
Hmm. You've got 28 straight wins, huh?\xF000븁\x0000\nThis time, I want to keep going\nwith this momentum.
You also beat the Subway Boss, right?\nSomeday I want to battle you, too!
When my favorite Poké Ball begins\nto shake, I tremble with excitement!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou're no ordinary Trainer, are you?\nPerhaps you are the Champion somewhere?
Winning battles feels good, but I've\ntraveled quite far...I wonder if I can\xF000븀\x0000\nget back in time for work tomorrow...
I finally have a 49-battle win streak.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf I can do this well at work, I wonder\nif I can get promoted...
Both you and I have won more than\n100 straight battles!\xF000븁\x0000\nI may have too much time on my hands,\nbut so do you.\xF000븁\x0000\nTake this to commemorate our meeting of\ntwo similar people!\xF000븁\x0000
It's a really precious Berry, but I don't\nknow how to use it other than to eat it\xF000븀\x0000\nas a snack...
It's a subway map of the Unova region.\xF000븁\x0000
Communicating. Please stand by...
