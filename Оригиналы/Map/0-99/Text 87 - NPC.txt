To be good at something, you have to do\nit repeatedly, day after day after day.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's how you get results.\nOtherwise, you won't get better at it.
When I was a kid, I played catch with\nmy Pokémon!
It's not bad to grow up.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut it's bad to forget what it felt like\nto be a child.
I have baseball, and I have Pokémon...\nHow happy I am!
If you don't swing a bat, you can't hit\na ball.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you don't do things, you won't fail...\nbut you won't succeed, either.
I give 100 percent of my energy all the\ntime! That is the only thing I can do.
What I brag about is my bat!
