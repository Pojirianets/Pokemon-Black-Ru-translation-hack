Hello, Trainer!\nI think Potions are important for a trip!
I should have bought more Poké Balls!\xF000븁\x0000\nA Pokémon I wanted to catch\njust came out, and I missed it!
Hi! I have some questions for you!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you want to play, which do you prefer:\noutside or at home?
I see, I see!\xF000븁\x0000\nThen, which one are you interested in:\nthe thing everybody knows\xF000븀\x0000\nor the thing nobody knows?
Oh, really?\xF000븁\x0000
In my view, you are a person with\ncommon sense!
I'd say you are quite active!
I'd say you are very curious!
I'd say you are quite composed!
I'd say you are quite relaxed!
Outside
At home
Neither
The thing everybody knows
The thing nobody knows
