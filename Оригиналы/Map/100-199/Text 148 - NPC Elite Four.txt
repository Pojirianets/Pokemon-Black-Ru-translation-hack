Who are you?\nHow impudent you are to disturb my sleep.\xF000븁\x0000\nHmf...\xF000븁\x0000\nYou appear to possess a combination of\nstrength and kindness. Very well.\xF000븁\x0000\nMake your best effort not to bore me\nwith a yawn-inducing battle. Clear?\xF000븁\x0000
You haven't faced all of the members\nof the Elite Four yet, have you?\xF000븁\x0000\nDon't concern yourself about me.\nGo on ahead.
In the past, when I battled, the force\nof my emotions shook me greatly.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen my power awoke, I came close to\ndestroying everything around me.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat weak person no longer exists...\nStill, sometimes, my determination fails.\xF000븁\x0000\nAlways, I aspire to wrap up a victory\nwith elegance and grace.\xF000븁\x0000\nI invite you to be my opponent\nagain in the future, if you wish.
Somehow, you managed to defeat the\nentire Elite Four of the Pokémon League.\xF000븁\x0000\nCheck the statue in the center of the\nplaza for the way to the Champion's room.
Who's there?\nWho is so uncouth as to disturb my sleep?\xF000븁\x0000\nHmf... It's you again.\xF000븁\x0000\nStill, you possess that combination of\nkindness and strength. Yet you seem\xF000븀\x0000\nstronger than before...\xF000븁\x0000\nDo be sure not to bore me with a\nsnooze-inducing battle, is that clear?\xF000븁\x0000
Alas! Even with the knowledge and skill\npassed down in my family of Trainers,\xF000븀\x0000\nI still can't win.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe reason I came here in the first place\nwas to encounter Trainers like you...
In the past, my untrained heart made my\npower run wild.\xF000븀\x0000\nI was forbidden to battle.\xF000븁\x0000\nAll I craved then was to experience the\npure excitement of battling like this.\xF000븁\x0000\nHee hee...\nAlthough I'm embarrassed, I can't help\xF000븀\x0000\nsmiling right now.
You have defeated the\nPokémon League's Elite Four.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou have earned the right to\nproceed to the Champion's room.\xF000븁\x0000\nMaking an entrance is not the point.\xF000븁\x0000\nOnce you're there, you'll need to\nunleash your power to the fullest!
