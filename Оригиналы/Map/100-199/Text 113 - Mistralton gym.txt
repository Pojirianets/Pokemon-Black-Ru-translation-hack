Hee-hee!\nI've been waiting for you.\xF000븁\x0000\nDid you enjoy flying with the help of\nthe Mistralton Gym cannons?\xF000븁\x0000\nThey're my pride and joy!\xF000븁\x0000\nThis time, let's try something else!\xF000븁\x0000
You're an amazing Pokémon Trainer.\xF000븁\x0000\nMy Pokémon and I are happy,\nbecause for the first time in a while,\xF000븀\x0000\nwe could fight with our full strength.\xF000븁\x0000\nThis is an official League Gym Badge.\nI think it will look good on you.\xF000븁\x0000
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 received the\nJet Badge from Skyla.\xF000븁\x0000
Wow, hot stuff!\xF000븁\x0000\nWith that many Gym Badges,\nPokémon up to Lv. 70 will obey you.\xF000븁\x0000\nAlso, as thanks for a Pokémon battle\nthat made me very happy,\xF000븀\x0000\nI want you to have this TM.\xF000븁\x0000
My present to you is Acrobatics.\nIf the user doesn't have a held item,\xF000븀\x0000\nits power doubles.\xF000븀\x0000\nIt's a pretty technical move.\xF000븁\x0000\nBe sure to compensate for the\nlack of a held item!\xF000븁\x0000\nBy the way, when I flew over\nTwist Mountain on the way\xF000븀\x0000\nto Icirrus City...\xF000븁\x0000\nTeam Plasma--is that the name?\nAnyway, they were heading for the city.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat kind of people are they?
Icirrus City, where you'll find the next\nGym, is past Route 7, just after you\xF000븀\x0000\ncross Twist Mountain.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's a hop, skip, and a jump when flying,\nbut it's a really challenging walk.\xF000븁\x0000\nHeads up! Make sure you're ready for it!
Skyla: Are you and your Pokémon well?\nOur battle together was so much fun.\xF000븁\x0000\nNow, my Pokémon and I have started\ntraining again.\xF000븁\x0000\nI don't usually let people travel in my\ncargo plane, but battling with you was\xF000븀\x0000\nsuch a blast that I'd make an exception.
Please take this Fresh Water!\xF000븁\x0000
Just between you and me...\xF000븁\x0000\nRock, Electric, Ice... Flying types have\nmore weaknesses than people know about.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you use Pokémon and moves of those\ntypes, victory is practically yours!\xF000븁\x0000\nBy the way, to proceed in this Gym,\nyou climb in the cannons to move forward.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe cannons go up, down, left, and right.\nYou can get in them from anywhere!
Woo! Not many people look that good\nbeing shot out of a cannon...\xF000븀\x0000\nYou make it look easy!\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd congratulations on your victory\nagainst the Gym Leader.
