The slow passage of time in\nOpelucid City...\xF000븀\x0000\nIt fits an old woman like me perfectly.
In Opelucid City, you can spend your\ndays in leisure and opulence...
Sometimes, I think this...\xF000븁\x0000\nThere could be another world, where\na person who looks just like me\xF000븀\x0000\nlives in a completely different way...
I imagine that even the exact same\nperson would change a lot by living in a\xF000븀\x0000\ndifferent world.
