My daughter has wanted to investigate\nthat tower for a long time.\xF000븁\x0000\n“What! There's something I don't know?!"\nThat kind of feeling is pure adventure.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd I'm not too old for some adventuring.\nAway I go to have a look at\xF000븀\x0000\nDragonspiral Tower!\xF000븀\x0000\nCatch you later!\xF000븁\x0000

Brycen: Now, hang on.\xF000븁\x0000\nYoung man, if you're here for\na Gym challenge, hang on for a bit.\xF000븁\x0000\nI've got to head to Dragonspiral Tower!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: I'm going, too.\xF000븁\x0000\nDragonspiral Tower is to the north\nof here, right?\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Whoooooa! Whoa.\nWh-what should I do?\xF000븁\x0000\nF-for now, I have to go to\nDragonspiral Tower...\xF000븀\x0000\nOK! I'm heading north!\xF000븁\x0000
