When a Pokémon learns the move\nHidden Power, somehow I can tell\xF000븀\x0000\nwhat type that move will be!\xF000븁\x0000\nShould I tell you what type of\nHidden Power your Pokémon will learn?
Now that I'm aware of my hidden power,\nI can tell you what type of Hidden Power\xF000븀\x0000\nyour Pokémon will learn!\xF000븀\x0000\nDo you want to know?
If this Pokémon were to learn\nHidden Power, the move's type\xF000븀\x0000\nwould be \xF000ă\x0001\x0000!
The type of this Pokémon's\nHidden Power would be \xF000ă\x0001\x0000!
If you want to know, ask me, and I'll\nactivate my hidden power for you!
It's not possible for an Egg to use\nHidden Power!
I'm sorry, but this Pokémon can't learn\nto use Hidden Power.
The Entree and Pass Power...\nWhat in the world is the Entralink?
