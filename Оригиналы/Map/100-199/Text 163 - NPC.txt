In order to eliminate the old-fashioned\nways of looking at things...
We will steal Pokémon!\nYou'll never play together again!
If their Pokémon are liberated,\nTrainers will no longer be Trainers!
We are in the right!
Everyone else is wrong!
If you don't think the same way we think,\nwe'll use all our power to eliminate you!
Burgh: Well, you see...\xF000븁\x0000\nThere are two ways out of\nPinwheel Forest--\xF000븁\x0000\nthe road that goes straight and the\npath that winds through the woods.\xF000븁\x0000
I will take the straight road after them!\xF000븁\x0000
If they're not there,\nI'll block the exit.\xF000븁\x0000
Would you please take the other way\nand check whether Team Plasma\xF000븀\x0000\nis hiding in there somewhere?\xF000븁\x0000\nYou'll run into a lot of Trainers,\nbut it's basically a single path,\xF000븀\x0000\nso I'm sure you won't get lost.\xF000븁\x0000
Come on!\nLet's do this for Lenora's sake!\xF000븁\x0000
Burgh: Mm-hmm?\xF000븁\x0000\nTeam Plasma hasn't come\nin this direction...\xF000븁\x0000\nThe forest's bug Pokémon are quiet, too.
Burgh: Mm-hmm?\xF000븁\x0000\nTeam Plasma hasn't come\nin this direction...\xF000븁\x0000\nThe forest's bug Pokémon are quiet, too.\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: You stubborn brat!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen I'm through with you,\nyou won't be able to chase us anymore!\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Too bad!\nI haven't got anything!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you want to get it back,\nyou're just gonna have\xF000븀\x0000\nto look for my associates!
Team Plasma: My, my.\nCould you be looking for something?\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Sorry!\nI'm empty handed.\xF000븁\x0000\nDo I look like the kind of girl\nto carry a heavy load?\xF000븁\x0000\nBetter try somewhere else!
Team Plasma: So you made it this far!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll hold you here so my friends\ncan get away!\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Yep! I'm here to buy time!\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd if you don't step lively,\nwe're going to get away!
Team Plasma: A pursuer?\xF000븁\x0000\nUh, ha ha. A kid like you--\nbeat some of us?!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat can't be helped, but...\nI'll take you on now!\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Fine.\nTake your stupid skull!\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: So the dream our king had--\nthe dream we had--won't come true...\xF000븁\x0000
Gorm: How are you holding up,\nfellow subject of our king?\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Gorm of the Seven Sages!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm mortified that this skull, which we\nwent to so much trouble to obtain,\xF000븀\x0000\nwas stolen from us so easily.\xF000븁\x0000
Gorm: It's not important.\xF000븁\x0000\nWe can afford to abandon\nthe Dragon Skull.\xF000븁\x0000\nAccording to the results of our\nresearch, this is not the legendary\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon for which Team Plasma is looking.\xF000븀\x0000\nIt is completely unrelated.\xF000븁\x0000
But we will not allow anyone to disrupt\nour plans and get away with it.\xF000븁\x0000\nWe will fix it so you never interfere\nwith us again.\xF000븁\x0000
Burgh: Oh, sweet!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe bug Pokémon were getting\nall worked up, so here I come,\xF000븀\x0000\nand what do I spy with my little eye?\xF000븁\x0000\nThis important-looking guy!\xF000븁\x0000\nAre you here to help your friends,\nwhom I defeated?\xF000븁\x0000
Lenora: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\nBurgh!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe others didn't have anything...\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd who are you supposed to be?\xF000븁\x0000\nIs this guy the big boss?\xF000븁\x0000
Gorm: I am one of the Seven Sages\nof Team Plasma.\xF000븁\x0000\nGhetsis, another of the Seven Sages,\nwill liberate Pokémon with words alone!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe remainder of the Seven Sages have\nordered their compatriots to take\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon with full force!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut the odds are a little against us now.\xF000븁\x0000\nTo you, the Bug Pokémon user Burgh and\nthe Normal Pokémon user Lenora, I say...\xF000븁\x0000\nKnow your enemies, know yourself,\nand you need not fear the result\xF000븀\x0000\nof a hundred battles...\xF000븀\x0000\nThis time, we shall retreat quietly.\xF000븁\x0000
To secure the liberation of Pokémon,\nwe will steal Pokémon from Trainers!\xF000븁\x0000\nEven though you are Gym Leaders,\nwe will not tolerate any further\xF000븀\x0000\nobstruction from you.\xF000븁\x0000\nIn any case, we will settle this someday.\xF000븁\x0000\nI hope you are looking forward\nto that time as much as I...\xF000븁\x0000
Lenora: They're a speedy bunch.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat are you planning to do, Burgh?\nAre you going to chase them?\xF000븁\x0000
Burgh: Hmmm...\xF000븁\x0000\nWe got back the stolen skull,\nand if we corner them, there's\xF000븀\x0000\nno telling what they might do.\xF000븁\x0000\nI think I'll be heading back, Lenora...\xF000븁\x0000
Well, now. Well...\nI'll be waiting for your challenge at\xF000븀\x0000\nCastelia City's Pokémon Gym.\xF000븁\x0000\nYes, indeed.\nI'm certainly looking forward to it!\xF000븁\x0000
Lenora: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou're holding the Dragon Skull you\nworked so hard to get back, right?\xF000븁\x0000
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 gave the\n\xF000ĉ\x0001\x0001 to Lenora!\xF000븁\x0000
Lenora: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, thank you so much.\xF000븁\x0000\nWith a kind Trainer like you\ntaking care of them, the Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nwith you must be happy.\xF000븁\x0000\nHere is a token of my gratitude.\nPlease use it carefully!\xF000븁\x0000
Lenora: This is a Moon Stone!\xF000븁\x0000\nSome Pokémon evolve when you\nuse this item on them.\xF000븁\x0000\nNow, I must take the Dragon Skull\nback to the museum!\xF000븁\x0000\nSee you! Take care of yourself!\xF000븁\x0000
I run every day!\nMy goal is to be the marathon champion\xF000븀\x0000\nof the Unova region!
The trees cut on this forest road are\nsent from Driftveil City to the world.
Have you heard of phytoncides?\xF000븁\x0000\nI don't really understand, but I heard\nthat the reason forests make you\xF000븀\x0000\nfeel good is phytoncides!
Hmm... I can feel it...\nThe presence of fierce Pokémon.
The surface is covered with moss.\nTouching it feels good somehow.
Trainer Tips!\xF000븁\x0000\n\nA forest is likely to contain many\nwell-hidden items!\xF000븁\x0000\nThey may be hard to find,\nso look carefully!
