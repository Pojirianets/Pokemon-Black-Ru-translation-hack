Hi! I'm Iris, the amazingly strong\nGym Leader!\xF000븁\x0000\nTell me... What Pokémon are you using?\nHow will you fight?\xF000븁\x0000\nOoh, I'm super curious, so let's just\nget started!\xF000븁\x0000
Whoooa!\nThat was so cool!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm sooo happy I could battle a Trainer\nas strong as you!\xF000븁\x0000
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 received the Legend Badge\nfrom Iris.\xF000븁\x0000
Hey, that's your eighth Badge, right?\nThat's so cool!\xF000븁\x0000\nNow every Pokémon will do what you ask,\nno matter how big they are!\xF000븁\x0000\nKnow what? I'll give you this TM, too!\xF000븁\x0000
Dragon Tail doesn't just do damage.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt sends the other Pokémon back to its\nPoké Ball, too!\xF000븁\x0000
Ooh, hey!\nI wonder how Mister Alder is doing?\xF000븁\x0000\nI wonder if he's battling that Trainer\ncalled N in the Pokémon League right now?\xF000븁\x0000\nDo you know about the Pokémon League?\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's past Victory Road, at the end of\nRoute 10!
You've been on a journey and seen a lot\nof the world.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm like that, too! I'm from way out in\nthe country.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm really happy that I've gotten to\nmeet lots of different people\xF000븀\x0000\nand Pokémon!!

Welcome. Thank you for coming. I am\nOpelucid Pokémon Gym's Leader, Drayden.\xF000븁\x0000\nAs the mayor, I've given everything\nto developing the city.\xF000븁\x0000\nAs a Trainer, I've simply been pursuing\ngreater strength.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut what I'm searching for now is a young\nTrainer who can show me a bright future.\xF000븁\x0000\nPerhaps you can show me that future,\nthe way Iris has?\xF000븁\x0000
Wonderful.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm grateful we had a chance to meet\nand battle.\xF000븁\x0000
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 received the Legend Badge\nfrom Drayden!\xF000븁\x0000
Well, now. You've obtained all of the\nGym Badges in Unova.\xF000븁\x0000\nNow, all Pokémon will obediently follow\nyour commands.\xF000븁\x0000\nI also want you to have this.\nIt's a TM I'm particularly fond of.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's called Dragon Tail.\xF000븁\x0000
Dragon Tail is a move that returns the\ndamaged Pokémon to its Poké Ball.\xF000븁\x0000\nIn other words, it switches your\nopponent's Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000
Now, I have something to ask of you.\xF000븁\x0000\nHead for the Pokémon League and\ngo after Alder.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe Pokémon League is past Route 10,\nwhich runs from Opelucid City\xF000븀\x0000\nto Victory Road.\xF000븁\x0000\nI know Alder's strength, but I don't\nknow the depths of N's power...
Pokémon and people do not age because of\nthe passage of time.\xF000븁\x0000\nThey get old when the energy flowing in\ntheir hearts dries up.\xF000븁\x0000\nThis energy in our hearts is powered by\ntruth, ideals, or maybe dreams...\xF000븁\x0000\nThat probably changes with what you most\nhope for in your life.
Thanks for coming!\nI happily welcome you!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut...\nI may be a little rough on you!\xF000븁\x0000
Advancing or retreating is up to you.\nBut if you proceed, prepare yourself!\xF000븁\x0000\nMoving forward halfheartedly is\ndisrespectful to your Pokémon!
Welcome to the Opelucid Gym, the Unova\nregion's strongest and biggest trial!\xF000븁\x0000\nFirst off, please take this Fresh Water.\nIt'll help you in the challenge ahead.\xF000븁\x0000
Let me give you a brief explanation of\nthe trick to the Opelucid Gym!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe path around this Gym is shaped like\ntwo dragons.\xF000븁\x0000\nThis path changes when you step on\nthe switches on the dragons' arms.\xF000븁\x0000\nPay attention to how the dragons'\nnecks move!
You beat the Gym Leader?\nWow, that's amazing!\xF000븁\x0000\nOh, by the way, since I gave you all that\nFresh Water...\xF000븀\x0000\nDon't you owe me some of your winnings?\xF000븁\x0000\n...I'm kidding! It's just a joke!\nNo, seriously, congratulations!
