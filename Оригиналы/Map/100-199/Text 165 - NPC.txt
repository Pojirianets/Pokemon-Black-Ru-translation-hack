I'm going to see the ruins, but I'm afraid\nI might get lost in the desert.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's really big, and sometimes you run\ninto Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nWill I be in trouble if I am not strong?
I hear you can find the newly discovered\nentrance of the ruins if you go through\xF000븀\x0000\nthe gate and just head straight.
Desert Resort Ahead\nIt's nicer than the average desert!
