Do you think all people in the world can\nunderstand one another?
I see. I think so, too!
Well...but you and your Pokémon\nunderstand each other.\xF000븁\x0000\nIsn't that right?
This happened to me once after\nI crossed a bridge.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen I was at a loss, the person who\nhelped me was a total stranger...\xF000븁\x0000\nAfter all, helping each other is\nimportant in life.
What is a strong mind?\nWhat is kindness?\xF000븁\x0000\nAre there any Trainers and Pokémon\nwho possess those qualities?
When I go to the Entralink next time,\nI'd like to register a Pass Power and\xF000븀\x0000\nmake everyone smile!
\xF000븉\x0001\x0002People who visited the Entralink\nhid items somewhere...\xF000븀\x0000\nThe Entralink is unique, isn't it?\xF000븉\x0001\x0000
I want other people to like me...\nThere is a reward...\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's OK to help people with\nsuch motivations.\xF000븀\x0000\nBecause helping is itself a great thing!
Living is using time given to you.\nYou cannot recall lost time.\xF000븁\x0000\nDon't forget that...
Happiness is here today, gone tomorrow.\xF000븁\x0000\nThere is no everlasting happiness, so\ndon't be greedy.
