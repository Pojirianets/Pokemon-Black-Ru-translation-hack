I may walk fast, but I live a slow and\nrelaxing life.
I'm going home early today to have\nPokémon battles with my sisters.
Hello!\nGreeting is important, isn't it?
They say time is money. But when you\nspend time, you can't get it back.
There are always so many people here...
Even when I loaf, I do it all-out.\nI am always serious!
This city is a sleepless city...\nBut I need my beauty sleep.
I wish there were shoes\nthat recharge energy by walking!
My big customer must be waiting...
I just keep walking...today, tomorrow,\nand the day after tomorrow.
Good luck! Me!\nGood luck! You!
I will watch a baseball game\nthis weekend.
I am having a battle called a job!\nThis is quite tough. That's why it's fun!
Hmmm... It may be a good idea\nto Dress Up your Pokémon.
Have you had a Pokémon battle\nwith the Gym Leader, Burgh?\xF000븁\x0000\nHe's a strange one, but he likes Pokémon\nvery much.
I haven't traveled with my Pokémon\nfor a long time. I feel like doing that...
I will go to the Kanto region\nfor business.
People from different countries\ngather here in Castelia City.
Everyone is a professional walker!
Even in the crowd of people,\ndon't lose sight of yourself!
Every day, everybody goes their own way.
My business card has a picture of\nthe Pokémon I like best.
I always walk here, so\nI am good at dodging people.
Argh! You distracted me! I was trying\nto count all the pedestrians!
Hey, hey, kid!\nIt's dangerous!
Will you become a motorbike rider\nwhen you grow up?
The night wind is piercing right through\nme... My motorbike is freezing, too...
Zowieee!
Wooooo!
Is that so?
Yes.
Huh?
Oh, no!
What's up?
Sorry.
Bye-bye!
Nah.
Eep!

How is it?
Hello!

Ouch...
