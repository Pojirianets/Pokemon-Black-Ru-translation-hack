Drayden: I'll explain.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat you are holding is the Light Stone.\xF000븁\x0000\nReshiram, who will likely awaken from the\nLight Stone, and Zekrom, who is already\xF000븀\x0000\nawake, were once the same Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: That single Dragon Pokémon,\nalong with twin heroes,\xF000븀\x0000\nbrought a new region into being.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd people and Pokémon had happy lives!\xF000븁\x0000
Drayden: One day, however...\xF000븁\x0000\nThe twin heroes, the older brother\nwho sought the truth, and the\xF000븀\x0000\nyounger brother who sought ideals,\xF000븀\x0000\nbegan to argue about how to decide\xF000븀\x0000\nwhich one of them was right...\xF000븁\x0000\nThe single Dragon-type Pokémon\nthat had been with them all that time\xF000븀\x0000\nsplit its body into two.\xF000븁\x0000\nOne sided with the older brother,\nand the other with the younger brother.\xF000븁\x0000

Iris: In its pursuit of truth, the white\nDragon-type Pokémon sought to usher\xF000븀\x0000\nin a new and better world...\xF000븁\x0000\nIts name was Reshiram.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd the other, the black Dragon-type\nPokémon, sought ideals and\xF000븀\x0000\nto usher in a new world--a world of hope.\xF000븁\x0000\nIts name was Zekrom.\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: In its pursuit of ideals, the black\nDragon-type Pokémon sought to usher\xF000븀\x0000\nin a new and better world...\xF000븁\x0000\nIts name was Zekrom.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd the other, the white Dragon-type\nPokémon, sought truth, and to\xF000븀\x0000\nusher in a new world--a world of good...\xF000븁\x0000\nIts name was Reshiram.\xF000븁\x0000
Drayden: Because the two of them\nwere once the same entity,\xF000븀\x0000\ntheir battle raged endlessly\xF000븀\x0000\nand neither one could be\xF000븀\x0000\ndeclared the winner.\xF000븀\x0000\nThey simply exhausted themselves.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe twin heroes proclaimed that there\nwas no one side that was right\xF000븀\x0000\nand ceased the conflict.\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: But, but...\xF000븁\x0000\nThe two heroes' sons started the\nbattle again! And an instant later,\xF000븀\x0000\nReshiram and Zekrom destroyed\xF000븀\x0000\nUnova with fire and lightning!\xF000븁\x0000\nThen, they disappeared!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut, but...\nIf people work with Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nin the right way, we don't have to worry\xF000븀\x0000\nanymore about the world being destroyed.\xF000븁\x0000\nI mean, Reshiram and Zekrom\nworked hard for everyone\xF000븀\x0000\nand made a new region!\xF000븁\x0000\nSo, it should be all right, I think.\xF000븁\x0000

Drayden: True.\nPokémon cannot speak.\xF000븁\x0000\nPeople may hurt Pokémon even more by\nimposing their selfish thoughts on them.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut, no matter what, Pokémon and people\nbelieve in each other, need each other,\xF000븀\x0000\nand will continue to live together...\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: Yeah!\xF000븁\x0000\nSo I'm never gonna forgive Team Plasma\nfor trying to separate Pokémon and us!\xF000븁\x0000
Drayden: Sorry.\nWe got a little off topic at the end.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat is everything we know.\xF000븁\x0000\nUnfortunately, we don't know how\nto wake up the legendary Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000
Drayden: I made a promise to Alder.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou must win the Gym Badge from\nthe Opelucid Pokémon Gym.\xF000븁\x0000
Iris, you go and be \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000's\nopponent at the Pokémon Gym.\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: Yay!\xF000븁\x0000\nLook out! I'm really, really strong,\njust like Drayden!\xF000븁\x0000
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, I'll be waiting for\nyour challenge at the Pokémon Gym!\xF000븁\x0000
Drayden: What will it accomplish\nto separate the worlds of people\xF000븀\x0000\nand Pokémon?\xF000븁\x0000\nThe way we live now, with different beings\nunderstanding and forgiving each other,\xF000븀\x0000\nis much richer. That's my belief.
Iris: Everyone, people and Pokémon can\nget along and be happy. That's awesome!
