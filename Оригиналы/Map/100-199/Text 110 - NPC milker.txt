There are medicinal herbs that make\nPokémon healthy.\xF000븁\x0000
The medicinal herbs imported from\nanother region work very well!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut Pokémon don't seem to like them,\nbecause they taste a little bitter.
Welcome! This is straight from the farm!\xF000븁\x0000\nMoomoo Milk--one bottle for $500.\nWould you like some for your trip?

You! Glad you came!\nGet good at Expert Belts! \xF000븁\x0000\nIf a Pokémon has an Expert Belt, the\npower of its moves is slightly boosted\xF000븀\x0000\nwhen they are super effective!
There must be a convenient town where\neverything is imported and everything\xF000븀\x0000\nis available.
Somewhere, there's a laid-back town\nwhere people value the year's seasons.\xF000븁\x0000\nI heard we've imported a lot of goods\nfrom that town!
Looking at seasonal vegetables is fun.\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause when the seasons change,\nthe vegetables available change!
Whenever we come to the market,\nvegetables of all seasons are available.\xF000븀\x0000\nIsn't that a marvel?
Goods carried away from Driftveil arrive\nin a town somewhere else...\xF000븁\x0000\nYeah. The world is connected.
Goods carried away from a town\nsomewhere else arrive in Driftveil...\xF000븁\x0000\nYeah. The world is connected.
