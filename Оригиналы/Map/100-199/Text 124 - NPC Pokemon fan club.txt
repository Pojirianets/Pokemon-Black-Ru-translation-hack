Ahem!\xF000븁\x0000\nI am the chairman who loves Pokémon the\nmost among Pokéfans in the entire world!\xF000븁\x0000
If you are a Trainer, will you show me\nhow you are raising your Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nwith loving care?
Oh, I understand!\nYou are a shy Trainer!
Oh!\nWhich Pokémon will you show me?\xF000븁\x0000

...Hmmm.\nIt's hard to tell...
Well...it's a bit hard to tell how much\nthat Egg has grown.
Oh! This \xF000ā\x0001\x0000 was level \xF000Ȃ\x0001\x0001\nwhen you met, but now it's level \xF000Ȃ\x0001\x0002!\xF000븁\x0000
You've raised it very well.\nIt's received a lot of love from you.\xF000븁\x0000
You've raised it quite well.\nI feel your love for this Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000
You've raised it well.\nYou must be affectionate.\xF000븁\x0000
I see! Although it's just a smidgen,\nI can feel your love for your Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000
That is a token of gratitude for showing\nme your great love for your Pokémon!
Well, you showed me good stuff!\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease keep raising your Pokémon\nwith loving care!
What? It has not grown at all.\xF000븁\x0000\nStill, if you travel with your Pokémon\nfrom now on, I am sure it will grow!
Welcome to the Pokémon Fan Club.\xF000븁\x0000\nShall I check how friendly your Pokémon\nis toward you?

I can't tell whether or not you and\nthe Egg are close friends.
Oh, my. Your \xF000ā\x0001\x0000...\xF000븁\x0000
It is super friendly to you!\nI'm a bit jealous!
It is quite friendly to you!\nYou must be a kind person!
It is friendly to you.\nIt must be happy with you.
It is a little friendly to you...\nThat's what I'm getting.
The relationship is neither good\nnor bad... It looks neutral.
Hmmm...\nIt may not like you very much.
By any chance, you...\xF000븁\x0000\nAre you a very strict person?\nI feel that it really doesn't like you...
Oh, you are so shy! Come on,\ndon't hide your Pokémon from me.
Muuun!
Glibalugga!
