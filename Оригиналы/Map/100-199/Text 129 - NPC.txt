I am coaching Iris.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut, honestly, she's been stronger than\nme ever since she came here!
The move Draco Meteor that Drayden\nteaches us is the strongest\xF000븀\x0000\nDragon-type move.\xF000븁\x0000\nHowever, it will sharply reduce\nSpecial Attack after use.

Concerned about your Pokémon's weight?\xF000븁\x0000\nYou don't need to put it on a diet!\nJust let it hold this.\xF000븁\x0000
The weight of a Pokémon holding a\nFloat Stone will be halved!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat way, you can reduce the damage\ncaused by weight-based moves such as\xF000븀\x0000\nLow Kick and Grass Knot.
I have an item that I don't know how to\nuse. Would you give it a try and see if\xF000븀\x0000\nyou can make it work?
I know...\nYou'll also have trouble figuring it out.
You may be able to master it. Here it is!\xF000븁\x0000
If a Pokémon holds a Ring Target, it can\nbe hit even by a move that would usually\xF000븀\x0000\nhave no effect.\xF000븁\x0000\nFor example, a Normal-type move would\nhit a Ghost-type Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nMastering this item is a bit tough...\nActually, it's very tough, but think\xF000븀\x0000\nhow useful it could be!
