Ryoku: I was planning to catch the\nPokémon called Volcarona that lives\xF000븀\x0000\nin this Relic Castle and present it\xF000븀\x0000\nto Ghetsis.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut the Shadow Triad said that Ghetsis\nhas gone somewhere, right?\xF000븁\x0000
The Seven Sages...\xF000븁\x0000\nWe always said we were complete when the\nseven of us were together.\xF000븁\x0000\nNow I don't know the meaning of those\nwords anymore.\xF000븁\x0000\nI guess I don't mind, even if we were\nbeing used, but the dream is over.\xF000븁\x0000
I no longer need this.\xF000븁\x0000\nGhetsis gave it to me, but I have no use\nfor it.\xF000븁\x0000
Ryoku: This Relic Castle and our own\ncastle are both crumbling...\xF000븁\x0000\nBut what's different is that this Relic\nCastle is the remains of a civilization.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd our castle left nothing behind...\xF000븁\x0000
Looker: Regarding Team Plasma...\xF000븁\x0000\nI am an officer of the International\nPolice, and you must satisfy my request\xF000븀\x0000\nfor certain information!\xF000븁\x0000
Ryoku: Understood.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut we don't know much about Ghetsis or\nour lord N!\xF000븁\x0000\nWe haven't even figured out if they are\nfather and son...\xF000븁\x0000
Looker: Accept my thanks!\xF000븁\x0000\nNow, Ghetsis notwithstanding,\nthere yet remains but \xF000Ȁ\x0001\x0000 of the\xF000븀\x0000\nSeven Sages still at large.\xF000븁\x0000\nThey are thinking--upon what topics?\nThey are hoping--upon what chances?\xF000븁\x0000\nThis is of the utmost urgency.\nAt once! On the way!\xF000븁\x0000
Looker: I thank you profoundly!\xF000븁\x0000\nCuriously, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000...\nThere is a topic on which we must speak.\xF000븁\x0000\nA report has reached my ears of someone\nfar from here. Indeed, this someone has\xF000븀\x0000\nspotted a person like N and a...\xF000븀\x0000\ndragon Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nI depart to validate the validity\nof this information.\xF000븀\x0000\nWe shall meet again, so until then, adieu.\xF000븁\x0000
