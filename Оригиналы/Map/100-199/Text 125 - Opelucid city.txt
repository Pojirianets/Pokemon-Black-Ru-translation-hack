Alder: Hello, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000.\nThis way.\xF000븁\x0000
Ghetsis... What a liar.\xF000븁\x0000\nDesperately trying to con\neveryone with his speech.\xF000븁\x0000
That's correct!\xF000븁\x0000\nOur lord N has combined his power with\nthe legendary Dragon-type Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nand intends to create a new world.\xF000븁\x0000\nWe herald the return of the hero of\nUnova, founder of this region.
Hero?
Dragon?
Legend!
Pokémon are different from people.\xF000븁\x0000\nThey are living beings who contain\nunknown potential.\xF000븁\x0000
They are living beings from whom we\nhumans have much to learn.\xF000븁\x0000
They are beings whose greatness we\nshould acknowledge!\xF000븁\x0000\nBeings who should be freed\nfrom our oppression!
Freed?
Pokémon?
We, Team Plasma, invite you to join us!\xF000븁\x0000\nWe all want to create a new world where\npeople and Pokémon are both free!\xF000븁\x0000\nLadies and gentlemen, I ask you now...\nPlease, release your Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd so I end my plea to you today.\xF000븁\x0000\nThank you one and all for your attention.\xF000븁\x0000
Is it true?\xF000븁\x0000\nHave we been making Pokémon suffer?\xF000븁\x0000
Hmm...\xF000븁\x0000\nMaybe we should release our Pokémon\nlike Team Plasma says...\xF000븁\x0000
No way!\xF000븁\x0000\nWithout Pokémon, I'll be lonely and sad!\xF000븁\x0000
What was that about?\nThat speech was off-the-charts strange!\xF000븁\x0000
The cooperation of people and Pokémon is\nhow Unova came to exist to begin with.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf a Pokémon really didn't want\nanything to do with humans,\xF000븀\x0000\nit would simply leave...\xF000븁\x0000\nCapturing a Pokémon in a Poké Ball\ndoesn't mean you've captured its heart.\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: Let's go, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: It's been a while, Iris\nand Drayden.\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: Oh! Mr. Alder!\n...And the guy who helped out that time.\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: Oh! Mr. Alder!\n...And the girl who helped out that time.\xF000븁\x0000
Drayden: What's wrong?\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat does the wandering Champion who\nleft the Pokémon League need from us?\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: Briefly, my request is this.\xF000븁\x0000\nTell us about the legendary\nDragon-type Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: Are you talking about Reshiram?\nOr Zekrom?\xF000븀\x0000\nWhat's the sudden interest?\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: Are you talking about Zekrom?\nOr Reshiram?\xF000븀\x0000\nWhat's the sudden interest?\xF000븁\x0000
Drayden: Moments ago, a troublemaker\nknown as Ghetsis was here.\xF000븁\x0000\nHe said a Trainer named N has\nreawakened Reshiram...\xF000븁\x0000
Drayden: Moments ago, a troublemaker\nknown as Ghetsis was here.\xF000븁\x0000\nHe said a Trainer named N has\nreawakened Zekrom...\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: Yes!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat Trainer called N apparently told\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 here to search for the\xF000븀\x0000\nother Dragon-type Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
Drayden: Let me check that I have\nthis straight.\xF000븁\x0000\nThis N, or what have you, presumes\nto set the two Dragon-type Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nagainst each other in battle\xF000븀\x0000\nto test his convictions?\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: Oh, no!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe Dragon-type Pokémon\nget along so well!\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: That's right, Iris.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe ones who make Pokémon battle\nare the Trainers...\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd it's so the Trainers and the Pokémon\ncan get to know each other better.\xF000븁\x0000
I'm going to the Pokémon League.\xF000븁\x0000\nNo, I guess in this case I should say I'm\n“returning" to the Pokémon League!\xF000븁\x0000\nOf course, I'll defeat N!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll teach him about the beauty of this\nworld, where Pokémon and Trainers\xF000븀\x0000\nlive together in harmony!\xF000븁\x0000\nAlso, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, I'll await your arrival.\xF000븁\x0000\nOnce you've obtained the Opelucid Badge,\ncome to the League!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe Opelucid Gym Leader is tough.\nTake care!\xF000븁\x0000
Farewell.\nI'm counting on you, Drayden and Iris!\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: Aww...\nHe's gone.\xF000븁\x0000\nIs he OK?\nHe looked kinda scary.\xF000븁\x0000
Drayden: Don't worry, Iris.\xF000븁\x0000\nHe is the strongest Trainer\nin all of Unova.\xF000븁\x0000
Well, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, is it?\nCome to my home.\xF000븁\x0000\nAs Alder asked, I'll tell you\neverything I can about the\xF000븀\x0000\nlegendary Dragon-type Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nIris, child, please show the way.\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: You bet! If it's Opelucid City,\nI can take you anywhere.\xF000븁\x0000\nAs for the story of Reshiram and Zekrom,\nwe'll tell you all we know about it!\xF000븁\x0000\nThis way!\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: You bet! If it's Opelucid City,\nI can take you anywhere.\xF000븁\x0000\nAs for the story of Zekrom and Reshiram,\nwe'll tell you all we know about it!\xF000븁\x0000\nThis way!\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: That way!\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: Just a little farther!\xF000븁\x0000
Iris: This is it!\xF000븁\x0000
A challenger?\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm sorry, but currently,\nour Gym Leader is at home.
If all Pokémon are released, Trainers and\nGym Leaders will no longer exist.\xF000븁\x0000\nFor better or worse, the world\nwould surely change...
The memories of everyone who has lived\nin this city have built up over the years\xF000븀\x0000\nwithout changing much.
This city changes endlessly.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd every change is engraved in the\nmemories of the people who live here.
I spent so many happy days training my\nPokémon as we grew stronger together...\xF000븁\x0000\nIf it will make my beloved Pokémon\na perfect being, however,\xF000븀\x0000\nI can't help but let it go.
Even if it is inconvenient, I think\nsome things shouldn't be changed.
Even if you love them, I think\nsome things have to be changed.
Hey hey! That person called N had the\nlegendary Pokémon with him, so he has\xF000븀\x0000\nto be the legendary hero, right?\xF000븁\x0000\nHe's going to change the world, isn't he?
I like older things better than new ones.\nThey're just more relaxing!
I like newer things better than old ones.\nThey're just so cool!
...No way! Without Pokémon, I'll be too\nlonely and sad!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut am I only using my Pokémon, then...?
The Gym Leader Iris is still a child, but\nthe mayor Drayden has recognized\xF000븀\x0000\nher power!
The Gym Leader Drayden is the mayor who\nleads Opelucid.\xF000븁\x0000\nHe is always training by wrestling\nwith Pokémon.
So, have we really been making\nour Pokémon suffer...?
Yes, I will keep moving forward together\nwith my Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nEven if I were to part ways with my\nPokémon, it wouldn't be because someone\xF000븀\x0000\nelse said to, but because we decided to.
I'll definitely keep moving forward\ntogether with my Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nI won't take their company for granted.\nI'll appreciate how amazing that is!
The legendary Pokémon is the symbol\nof Unova.\xF000븁\x0000\nDoes that mean Team Plasma is right?\n...I don't know.
Pursuing ideals is different from person\nto person and Pokémon to Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nIn this city, it seems the ideal is\nto cherish the past.
The truth people pursue is different\nfrom person to person and\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon to Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nIn this city, it seems the truth is\nconstant change.
The hopes of an ancient people are put\ninto this melody...\xF000븁\x0000\nI will bring them back to us now.
Our hopes are put into this melody...\nI will send them to the future.
Professor Juniper: ...Hello!\nHow was Iris doing?\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: ...Hello!\nWas Drayden as tough as ever?\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, I came to report on how to\nresurrect the legendary Zekrom.\xF000븁\x0000\nI thought it would be better to tell you\nin person than over the Xtransceiver.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd as for the conclusion...\nWell, I haven't figured it out yet.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm sure the Pokémon will wake up\nwhen it deems someone worthy.\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, I came to report on how to\nresurrect the legendary Reshiram.\xF000븁\x0000\nI thought it would be better to tell you\nin person than over the Xtransceiver.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd as for the conclusion...\nWell, I haven't figured it out yet.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm sure the Pokémon will wake up\nwhen it deems someone worthy.\xF000븁\x0000
More importantly, aren't you amazing!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou have all eight of Unova's Gym Badges\nnow, right?\xF000븁\x0000\nYou've become so strong!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou probably don't even know it, but\nyou've changed a lot since you left\xF000븀\x0000\nNuvema Town.\xF000븁\x0000\nWell then, I'll show you where such a\nstrong Trainer should head next!\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: Pass through that\ngate, go down Route 10, and you'll arrive\xF000븀\x0000\nat the Badge Check Gates!\xF000븁\x0000\nOnce you get through Victory Road,\nwhich is past the gates, you're finally\xF000븀\x0000\nat the Pokémon League!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, that just made me think of when I was\nshowing you around the Pokémon Center\xF000븀\x0000\nin Accumula Town.\xF000븁\x0000\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000? Do you regret setting out\non your Pokémon journey?
Professor Juniper: Oh! That's OK,\ndon't worry! You don't have to tell\xF000븀\x0000\nme everything.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut I'm very happy that you three\nchose to train Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause they create chances to meet\nmore wonderful people and Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: Thanks! That's the\ngreatest answer you could give!\xF000븁\x0000\nI was really happy to be able to give\nyou three those Pokémon as a present!\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause Pokémon create chances to meet\nmore wonderful people and Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, this is a present for you!\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: This Master Ball is\nthe most powerful kind of Poké Ball.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt can catch any Pokémon without fail.\xF000븁\x0000\nThis is the only way I can support you,\nexcept to say...\xF000븀\x0000\nBe true to yourself.\xF000븁\x0000\nNo matter what happens, stay strong\nand keep going with your Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nSee you!\xF000븁\x0000
