Professor Juniper: Hi there, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000
I heard about these Pokémon statues,\nand I came to look into their origins!\xF000븁\x0000
I've learned that each of these Pokémon\nstatues is actually a real Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's called Darmanitan. It's sleeping,\nso it's become like a stone.\xF000븁\x0000
When I quickly measured how long\nthey've existed...\xF000븁\x0000\nIt was amazing! Around 2,500 years!\nSeems like they went to sleep that\xF000븀\x0000\nlong ago.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat means they've been here since\nbefore this place was in ruins, when\xF000븀\x0000\nthe Relic Castle was flourishing.\xF000븁\x0000\nPerhaps they were guarding the city.\xF000븁\x0000
These Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000\nThey are either in a state of hibernation\nor meditation, so if you wake them, they\xF000븀\x0000\nwill become active once again.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd the item that wakes up Darmanitan is\nactually...this RageCandyBar!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's why I will share one with you,\ntoo, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000
Well, I'm headed back to the\nPokémon Research Lab.\xF000븀\x0000\nBe seeing you!\xF000븁\x0000
It appears to be a statue of a Pokémon.
Give the RageCandyBar to the\nPokémon statue?
The ancient Pokémon statue responded to\nthe RageCandyBar.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe Pokémon was a sleeping Darmanitan!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe awakened Darmanitan attacked!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Stop, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: That's the entrance to the\nRelic Castle.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou're impressive, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000,\nmaking it here before I did.\xF000븁\x0000
Dealing with the Desert Resort's Pokémon\ntook longer than I would've thought.\xF000븁\x0000\nI only made it all the way out here\nthanks to my Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000
Alder went on ahead. Let's hurry.
Cheren: It's hard to put into words...\nbut I'll never forgive them for this!\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: What could that guy called\nN possibly want?\xF000븁\x0000\nCould he be trying to prove he is\nright by winning the battle of the\xF000븀\x0000\ntwo dragons?\xF000븁\x0000

The Xtransceiver is ringing.
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 picked up the Xtransceiver.\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: I could hear Professor Juniper's\nvoice from clear over here!\xF000븀\x0000\nSeems like something big is happening.\xF000븁\x0000\nI wonder what is waiting at the museum\nin Nacrene City.\xF000븀\x0000\nI'll go on ahead!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: I'll look around here once more.\xF000븁\x0000\nI don't want to believe what\nthat Ghetsis says...\xF000븁\x0000\nYou should head for the\nNacrene City Museum.
I came clear out to the Desert Resort\nto train, but...\xF000븁\x0000\nThere are so many Ground-type Pokémon,\nand I'm already in tatters...
You're the first person to come\nclear out here to talk to me!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm so moved!\nSo, I'll give you this!\xF000븁\x0000
If a Pokémon holds this Soft Sand, the\npower of its Ground-type moves goes up!
According to what I've heard, that\nRelic Castle is the ruins of a city built\xF000븀\x0000\nby the hero of old and the dragon\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon that accompanied the hero.

Oh! A sea of sand! I don't need\nGo-Goggles here!\xF000븁\x0000\nOh, I've come here all the way from\nthe Hoenn region.
