Cheren: Whew! I finally caught up.\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: You two. Come here...\nCome to my side.\xF000븁\x0000
Ghetsis: It looks like everyone is here.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt seems you are working hard\nto resurrect Zekrom, the other\xF000븀\x0000\nDragon-type Pokémon, aren't you?\xF000븁\x0000\nBut it appears the Dark Stone you seek\nis not here.\xF000븁\x0000
Ghetsis: It looks like everyone is here.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt seems you are working hard\nto resurrect Reshiram, the other\xF000븀\x0000\nDragon-type Pokémon, aren't you?\xF000븁\x0000\nBut it appears the Light Stone you seek\nis not here.\xF000븁\x0000
Well then, congratulations are in order!\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, you were chosen by our king.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you truly desire to keep the world as\nit is, where Pokémon live alongside\xF000븀\x0000\npeople, you must bring the other\xF000븀\x0000\nDragon-type Pokémon spoken of\xF000븀\x0000\nin legend and battle with our king.\xF000븁\x0000\nOtherwise, Team Plasma will steal every\nPokémon from every person in the world\xF000븀\x0000\nand release them all!\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: Release them, you say?\xF000븁\x0000\nDo the Pokémon who live with their\nTrainers actually want that?\xF000븁\x0000\nIs the liberation you talk about really\njust stealing Pokémon from people?\xF000븁\x0000
Ghetsis: What's this?\xF000븁\x0000\nChampion Alder, even though illness took\nthe Pokémon that had been your partner\xF000븀\x0000\nfor many years, and you haven't had a\xF000븀\x0000\nserious battle in all that time...\xF000븁\x0000\nEven you, who ordered the Elite Four to\nprotect the Pokémon League and left to\xF000븀\x0000\nwander the Unova region alone...\xF000븁\x0000\nEven a Champion like you now wants to\nprotect a world where Pokémon and\xF000븀\x0000\npeople live together?\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma's king will show the people of\nUnova that he is stronger than a\xF000븀\x0000\nChampion who keeps Pokémon bound!\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd just like the hero who founded\nUnova, he will be accompanied by the\xF000븀\x0000\nlegendary Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nHe will give this order!\n“Trainers, release your Pokémon!"\xF000븁\x0000\nFor this, we have prepared a suitable\ncastle for the legendary Reshiram and\xF000븀\x0000\nour king!\xF000븁\x0000

Alder: I won't lose!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll fight for all Trainers who love their\nPokémon, and for all Pokémon who believe\xF000븀\x0000\nin their Trainers!\xF000븁\x0000
Ghetsis: Our king has no interest in you.\xF000븁\x0000\nHe has already determined that victory\nagainst you is assured.\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: So you stayed behind just to\ntell me that? Just to make a fool of me?\xF000븁\x0000
Ghetsis: Of course not.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm doing this out of kindness.\nYes, kindness.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm making sure the Champion doesn't\nget hurt for no reason.\xF000븁\x0000\nGranted, the moment when\nsomeone loses all hope...\xF000븁\x0000\nI really do love to watch\nthat moment.\xF000븁\x0000\nWell then, farewell.\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Alder...\nWhat are you going to do now?\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: Hmmm...\xF000븁\x0000\nIt seems my only choice is to return to\nthe Pokémon League and battle N.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut it bothers me to do exactly what\nGhetsis wants...\xF000븁\x0000\nMore importantly, what should we do\nabout the Dark Stone?\xF000븁\x0000

Cheren: Alder...\nWhy don't we go outside for now?\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: Yes...that's a good idea.\nIt's hard to breathe in here!\xF000븁\x0000
