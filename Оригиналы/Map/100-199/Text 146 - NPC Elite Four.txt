Man oh man...\nWhat is going on today?\xF000븁\x0000\nChallengers coming one\nright after another.\xF000븁\x0000\nWell, no matter.\xF000븁\x0000\nI am Grimsley of the Elite Four, and I will\nfulfill my duty to be your opponent.\xF000븁\x0000
Whether or not you get to fight at full\nstrength, whether or not luck smiles\xF000븀\x0000\non you--none of that matters.\xF000븁\x0000\nOnly results matter. And a loss is a loss.\xF000븁\x0000\nSee, victory shines like a bright light.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd right now, you and your Pokémon\nare shining brilliantly.
Now, I'm nothing more than\nthe guy who lost...\xF000븁\x0000\nNothing more, nothing less.\nSigh...\xF000븁\x0000\nYou should take that strength and test\nit against the rest of the Elite Four.
Astonishing!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou have defeated every member of\nthe Pokémon League's Elite Four.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut it isn't over yet.\xF000븁\x0000\nThere is one more opponent against whom\nyou must prove your strength.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe pinnacle of the Pokémon League,\nthe Champion, Alder...\xF000븁\x0000\nOr, perhaps, that man called N has\ndefeated him and taken his title.\xF000븁\x0000\nI don't know which one you will face, but\ncheck the statue in the central plaza,\xF000븀\x0000\nand continue to the final room.
Life is a serious battle, and you have\nto use the tools you're given.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's more important to master the cards\nyou're holding than to complain about\xF000븀\x0000\nthe ones your opponents were dealt.\xF000븁\x0000\nLet us begin.\nAnd may the best Trainer win!\xF000븁\x0000\nContests like this are proof\nthat you are really living...\xF000븁\x0000
There are bad ways to win--\nand good ways to lose.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat's interesting and troubling is that\nit's not always clear which is which.\xF000븁\x0000\nA flipped coin doesn't always land\nheads or tails.\xF000븁\x0000\nSometimes it may never land at all...
Excellent!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe nice thing about Pokémon battles is\nthey teach the loser something, as well.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat said...\nYou should take that strength and test\xF000븀\x0000\nit against the rest of the Elite Four!
