Hrmph! So yer the Trainers Elesa was\ntalkin' about, huh.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm Clay. I'm the Gym Leader 'round\nthese parts.\xF000븁\x0000\nDon't be expectin' no welcome, now.\xF000븁\x0000\n'Cause when we lowered that bridge,\nthe Team Plasma guys we'd caught\xF000븀\x0000\ndone escaped in all the ruckus!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: What a bother.\xF000븁\x0000\nWe're grateful that you lowered the\nbridge, but how is it our fault that\xF000븀\x0000\nthey escaped?\xF000븁\x0000
Clay: Ya can say whatever ya want.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut what's important is y'all showed up,\nand then Team Plasma escaped.\xF000븁\x0000\nMaybe it's a little heavy-handed, but\nyou oughtta start lookin' for\xF000븀\x0000\nTeam Plasma, too.\xF000븁\x0000\nYer both talented Trainers, aren't ya?\xF000븁\x0000
Tell ya what...\xF000븁\x0000\nIf ya find Team Plasma, I'll let ya\nchallenge my Gym!\xF000븁\x0000\nLife's all about give and take!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Well, I suppose that's fair.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut really, we would have looked\nfor Team Plasma even if he hadn't asked.\xF000븁\x0000\nI can get stronger while beating that\nbothersome bunch...\xF000븁\x0000
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\nI'll go on ahead.\xF000븁\x0000
Ghetsis: Clay.\nIt's a pleasure to meet you.\xF000븁\x0000\nI am Ghetsis, of Team Plasma.\xF000븁\x0000\nI've come to pick up my associates\nwho are in your care.\xF000븁\x0000
Clay: I don't need no thanks, now.\xF000븁\x0000\nYer buddies were tryin' to steal\nsome folks' Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000
Ghetsis: What's this? It seems as if\nthere has been some misunderstanding.\xF000븁\x0000\nWe only free Pokémon from wicked people.\xF000븁\x0000
Clay: Well, that sounds real nice,\nif it's true.\xF000븁\x0000\nI may not talk purty, but at least\nI'm an honest man.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou talk real nice, but what yer sayin'\nkinda sounds like lyin'.\xF000븁\x0000\nSo tell me plain, what are ya tryin'\nto say?\xF000븁\x0000
Ghetsis: Team Plasma also has an interest\nin Driftveil City.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd we have many, many more members\nbesides those who are here...\xF000븁\x0000
Clay: ...Well, I can't tell if yer lyin' or\nnot, but I reckon you've won this\xF000븀\x0000\nwithout a fight.\xF000븁\x0000\nHrrmph. Fine. Take 'em and git!\xF000븁\x0000
Ghetsis: A decision worthy of a\nbusinessman called the Miner King.\xF000븁\x0000\nYour grasp of the situation\nis outstanding.\xF000븁\x0000\nWell then, we will be taking\nour colleagues off your hands...\xF000븁\x0000
Zinzolin: Ghetsis...\nThank you very much...\xF000븁\x0000
Ghetsis: Don't worry, my fellow servant\nof the king...\xF000븁\x0000\nWe are two of the Seven Sages,\nare we not?\xF000븁\x0000\nWell then, everyone, I expect that we\nwill meet again somewhere.\xF000븁\x0000
Clay: Sorry to let Team Plasma go after\nyou tracked 'em down, fellas.\xF000븁\x0000\nSay, why don't we cheer ourselves up\nwith a Pokémon battle?\xF000븁\x0000\nDon't keep me waitin'!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Well, we avoided a fight in\nthe middle of the city, anyway.\xF000븁\x0000\nStill, I can't help but think Ghetsis isn't\njust an ordinary person.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm off to go make my Pokémon stronger.\xF000븁\x0000\nI really don't want to lose\nto that Clay guy.\xF000븁\x0000\nActually, I'm going to win my\nGym Badge in a flawless victory!\xF000븁\x0000

Our Gym Leader, Clay, is in the\nmiddle of something right now.\xF000븀\x0000\nPlease come again later.
Bianca: Oh, hi, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!!\nGuess what, guess what?\xF000븁\x0000
Hey, were you at the Gym just now?\xF000븁\x0000\nOh, hey! That's Driftveil's Gym Badge!\nOh, that's totally cool. That's amazing.\xF000븁\x0000
No, no, no! I can't get distracted being\nall impressed with your shiny new Badge!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm also a Trainer!\nAt times like this you battle, right?\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: I haven't had a Pokémon battle\nwith you in a while, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou've become totally strong, huh?\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm not that strong, so I don't know\nhow to say it, but I think you're way\xF000븀\x0000\ntuned in to how your Pokémon feel!\xF000븁\x0000\nOh, you know what! I want to share this\nHM with you, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: My papa gave it to me after\nhe tried to take me home that time.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm sure it's so I can come home anytime\nhe wants, though...\xF000븁\x0000\nOh, hey, I have to share this with\nCheren, too...\xF000븁\x0000\nSee you, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000! Buh-bye!\xF000븁\x0000
So how about this city's pride and joy,\nthe drawbridge?\xF000븁\x0000\nWe also call it the Charizard Bridge\ndue to its elegant form!
Hey there, Trainer!\xF000븁\x0000\nHave you ever battled the Elite Four\nof the Pokémon League?\xF000븁\x0000\nYou can't battle them unless you\nhave eight Gym Badges, right?
Oh, ocean...\xF000븁\x0000\nI wonder if the tears I've cried\nwill flow all the way to Olivine City.
Those Team Plasma meanies forced me\nto battle them.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd when I lost, they stole my Pokémon!
When I win, it's because of my Pokémon.\nWhen I lose, it's because of me.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's how I always think. If you get\nconceited, you get sloppy fast.
The reason I'm hangin' around is\nbecause I want to hang around!\xF000븁\x0000\nAww! If my Pokémon just knew the move\nSurf, I could go on top of the water!
Some kids are catching and training\nPokémon close to the Cold Storage.
The Pokémon of lightning and the Pokémon\nof wind are both known to come and go\xF000븀\x0000\nas they please.
On the other side of the ocean, there\nare a lot of different people and a lot of\xF000븀\x0000\ndifferent Pokémon, aren't there?
The old guy on Route 6 is searching for\nlegendary Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you're interested, go talk to him!
Bridges are amazing. 'Cause they are a\nsymbol of connecting the world.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut the guy on Route 5 is saying the\nsame thing, isn't he?
I'm a heartbreaker...\nMy name... Charles.\xF000븁\x0000\nI wanted to get the attention of a girl\nI like, so I learned a new style of\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon battling.\xF000븁\x0000\nIts name... Triple Battle!\nWant to learn about it?
Oh, man! Getting someone's attention is\nreally hard.
In Triple Battles, you send out three\nPokémon at a time and battle!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe rules are simple: just make all of\nyour opponent's Pokémon faint.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd that's a rough explanation\nof Triple Battles.\xF000븁\x0000
I'm a heartbreaker...\nMy name... Charles.\xF000븁\x0000\nHey! If you're a Trainer, how about a\nTriple Battle?
You've got a good attitude, don't you!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm a heartbreaker...\nMy name... Charles.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm always at full throttle.\xF000븁\x0000
I hate to burst your bubble when you're\nall fired up, but...\xF000븁\x0000\nIn Triple Battles, you need three or\nmore Pokémon to battle.
I'm a heartbreaker...\nMy name... Charles.\xF000븁\x0000\nI have some advice for you.\nChallenge is the essence of life!
Sheesh. That's embarrassing. Getting\nschooled when I was planning to teach.\xF000븁\x0000\nStill, you have potential!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou have to understand your Pokémon\nto win in a Triple Battle.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you want more Triple Battles, you\nshould go to Opelucid City.
I'm a heartbreaker...\nMy name... Charles.\xF000븁\x0000\nRiding a bike and becoming the wind fits\na bad boy like me.

Oh, man! Getting someone's attention is\nreally hard.
In Rotation Battles, you send out three\nPokémon at a time and battle!\xF000븁\x0000\nOne Pokémon takes the lead position,\nand the other two stand on each side.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe trick is, each turn you can change\ntheir positions...\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd that's a rough explanation\nof Rotation Battles.\xF000븁\x0000
