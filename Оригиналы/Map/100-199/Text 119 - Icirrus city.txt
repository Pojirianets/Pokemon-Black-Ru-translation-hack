You appear ready to face a Gym Leader.\nThen...\xF000븁\x0000\nBring it!\xF000븁\x0000
In honor of your stout heart,\nI will give you this.\xF000븁\x0000
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 received\nthe Freeze Badge from Brycen!\xF000븁\x0000
You have seven Badges.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat means Pokémon up to Lv. 80\nwill obey you.\xF000븁\x0000\nThis TM will convey my regard\nfor your accomplishments.\xF000븁\x0000
A move that always results in\na critical hit: Frost Breath.
No matter how many battles I fight,\nI don't know what strength is.\xF000븁\x0000\nPerhaps you can find the answer.
Only those who are weak need to\nflaunt their strength.
Brycen: In the past, when I was hurt and\ndepressed, Alder shared this with me...\xF000븁\x0000\nThere is strength in being with other\npeople and Pokémon. Receiving their\xF000븀\x0000\nsupport makes you stronger.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe young man named Cheren\nalso seems to understand this now.
Please take this Fresh Water!\xF000븁\x0000
Ice can be melted with Fire\nor shattered with Fighting.\xF000븁\x0000\nOr you might want to smash it\ninto dust with Rock or Steel.
From Brycen, I've learned how to\nsay more with fewer words.
