When you use the move Fly, you can\nreturn to a Pokémon Center\xF000븀\x0000\nyou've already visited.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut if Pokémon don't know their\ndestinations, they cannot fly there!
Because I know a lot about planes,\nI can maintain them!\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause I know a lot about Pokémon,\nI can be strong!
For the places that I cannot reach,\nI ask Flying- or Psychic-type Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nfor help sometimes.\xF000븁\x0000\nI cannot even imagine everyday life\nwithout Pokémon.
Chulululuwa!
Because of this control tower, planes\ncan fly safely in the sky where there\xF000븀\x0000\nare no roads.\xF000븁\x0000\nFrom that, I take this lesson:\nIf Trainers lead Pokémon correctly,\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon will feel safe and fight well.
My dream was to become a Pilot and\nfly away, far away...\xF000븀\x0000\nI still have that dream in my heart.
Welcome to the sky city, Mistralton!\nTake this as a keepsake!\xF000븁\x0000
