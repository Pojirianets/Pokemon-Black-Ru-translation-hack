I want to know the future!\nI am very worried...\xF000븁\x0000\nI wonder how my child, Thyme, will spend\nthe future.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm making a machine that connects the\nfuture and the present, but electricity\xF000븀\x0000\nis desperately short.\xF000븁\x0000
I've heard that in another world,\nthere's another Opelucid City that looks\xF000븀\x0000\nvery futuristic.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf there is a Pokémon from that world\nthat knows the move Charge, the machine\xF000븀\x0000\nmay work.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you're able, would you be willing to\nlend me a Pokémon like that?
I...I see. What a pity.\nIf you change your mind, please return.
Th-thank you!\nNow my machine will work!\xF000븁\x0000
I appreciate the thought, but...you\ndon't have a Pokémon that meets the\xF000븀\x0000\nconditions I need.
I appreciate the thought, but although\nyour Pokémon knows Charge, it's not from\xF000븀\x0000\nthat other world...
Now, please show me the future!\xF000븁\x0000
Whirrr, whirrr, whirrr...\xF000븁\x0000
Oh! So that's what the future is like!\xF000븁\x0000\nMy precious Thyme is growing up as such\na good kid!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, it returned to normal...\xF000븁\x0000\nBut what an experience!\nI can't stop trembling!\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd even though I know the future,\nI guess my present time won't change.\xF000븁\x0000
I will return your Pokémon to you.\nThis is my thank-you gift.\xF000븁\x0000
Rather than worrying about the future,\nit is important to live in the present,\xF000븀\x0000\nwhich connects to the future, as best\xF000븀\x0000\nyou can.\xF000븁\x0000\nOK, Thyme! Let's go out later!\nToday, let's play as hard as we can!
Thyme: I, I...\nWhat will I be when I grow up?
I want to return to the past!\nI want to do many things over again!\xF000븁\x0000\nMy father, Bach, created a machine to\nsee the future.\xF000븁\x0000\nI am making a machine to connect with\nthe past.\xF000븁\x0000\n...But I don't have enough electricity.\xF000븁\x0000
I've heard that in another world,\nthere's another Opelucid City that looks\xF000븀\x0000\nvery old-timey.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf there is a Pokémon from that world\nthat knows the move Charge, the machine\xF000븀\x0000\nmay work.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you're able, would you be willing to\nlend me a Pokémon like that?
Ah... What a pity.\nThere is no other way...
Yes!\nNow, the machine will work.\xF000븁\x0000
You're nice to offer, but I'm afraid you\ndon't have a Pokémon that meets the\xF000븀\x0000\nconditions I need.
That's nice of you, but although your\nPokémon knows Charge, it's not from\xF000븀\x0000\nthat other world...
Now, we can connect with the past!\xF000븁\x0000
We connected with the past!\xF000븁\x0000\nFather! It's me, Thyme!\nI owe you an apology...\xF000븁\x0000
It returned to normal...\nIt seems to have run out of electricity.\xF000븁\x0000\nI connected with the past...but I guess\nmy present time won't change.\xF000븁\x0000
Oh!\nI will return your Pokémon to you.\xF000븁\x0000\nThank you.\nThis is my thank-you gift.\xF000븁\x0000
Rather than regretting the past...\nit is important to live in the present,\xF000븀\x0000\nwhich connects from the past,\xF000븀\x0000\nas best as you can.\xF000븁\x0000\nOK!\nI'll live positively!
I heard that my father had a fight with\nmy Grandpa Bach a long, long time ago!
