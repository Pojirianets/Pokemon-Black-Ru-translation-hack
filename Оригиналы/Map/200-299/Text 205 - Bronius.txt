Bronius: When I saw you in Castelia,\nI did not care about your existence.\xF000븁\x0000\nHere in the Chargestone Cave,\nGhetsis tested your ability...\xF000븁\x0000\nOnce more, we will test you to learn\nwhat it is you are.\xF000븁\x0000\nTeam Plasma, come out!\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Bronius of the Seven Sages,\nI will bring this kid down!\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: This kid is the real thing!\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Because of you,\nI'm now ex-Team Plasma.\xF000븁\x0000\nBeing an ex doesn't sound cool, does it?\nHow are you going to make it up to me?\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: An ex-Team Plasma member\nbecomes an ordinary Pokémon Trainer...\xF000븀\x0000\nThis was that moment.\xF000븁\x0000
Bronius: The Pokémon of our Team Plasma\nare also fighting for their Trainers.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt was so obvious that I overlooked it...\nThank you for reminding me of that.\xF000븁\x0000\nHere, I'd like you to take this.\xF000븁\x0000
Bronius: Pokémon do their best for their\nTrainers even when they are injured.\xF000븁\x0000\nI wonder whether my lord N understands\nwhat that means?\xF000븁\x0000
Looker: On the topic of Team Plasma...\xF000븁\x0000\nI am an officer of the\nInternational Police,\xF000븀\x0000\nso you would be wise\xF000븀\x0000\nto share all you know.\xF000븁\x0000
Bronius: Those who left Team Plasma and\nare behaving with respect and\xF000븀\x0000\nunderstanding toward Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000\nThem, please forgive!\nHowever, those who won't interact with\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon in a kind and honest way...\xF000븀\x0000\nEven I will never forgive them!\xF000븁\x0000
Looker: Truly, I thank you!\xF000븁\x0000\nNow, Ghetsis notwithstanding,\nthere yet remains but \xF000Ȁ\x0001\x0000 of the\xF000븀\x0000\nSeven Sages still at large.\xF000븁\x0000\nTheir innermost thoughts,\ntheir uttermost hopes...\xF000븀\x0000\nThese I must and shall discover!\xF000븀\x0000\nOnce more, a brief farewell!\xF000븁\x0000
Looker: Thank you!\xF000븁\x0000\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, there is something\nof which we must speak.\xF000븁\x0000\nA report has been received. By me.\nFar from here, a sighting occurred of a\xF000븀\x0000\nperson like N and--a dragon Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nI must instantly go to confirm the\ncomplete confirmation of this report.\xF000븀\x0000\nI will see you again, and soon!\xF000븁\x0000
