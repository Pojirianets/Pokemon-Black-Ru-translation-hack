Skreeree...
This Pokémon has become attached to me.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut as far as I'm concerned, a Pokémon\nis just a simple tool.\xF000븁\x0000\nI don't understand...
Will you go to the Pokémon League?
Go!\xF000븁\x0000
I see.
I don't need an item to catch\nPokémon anymore...\xF000븁\x0000
Poké Balls...\xF000븁\x0000\nFrom my point of view, they are items\nthat keep Pokémon confined.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut for Trainers like you, they are a way\nto bond with Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you run out of Poké Balls,\ncome see me. I will give one to you.
You need a Poké Ball?\nOK. Take this.\xF000븁\x0000
