Wahaha. Isn't this a beautiful bridge?\xF000븁\x0000\nThis old bridge was built when my\ngreat-great-great-grandfather\xF000븀\x0000\nwas around.
My grandpa is a stonecutter for\nVillage Bridge!
Isn't this a unique sort of bridge?\xF000븁\x0000\nA long time ago, the river overflowed,\nand all the houses were washed away.\xF000븁\x0000\nSo people built new houses on top of the\nbridge to keep them safe from flooding!\xF000븀\x0000\nIt's a simple solution, but it's genius!
