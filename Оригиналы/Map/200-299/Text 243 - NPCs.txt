Do you want to go back to Castelia City?
We are just about to leave, so please\nget on board and wait a moment.\xF000븁\x0000
Just come talk to me when you want\nto return to Castelia City!
That Team Plasma...\xF000븁\x0000\nThey sure do terrible things!
The smell of the ocean is so soothing!
Waaah! I'm scared!
You sure took care of\nthose bad guys, mister!
You sure took care of\nthose bad guys, miss!
Making my grandchild cry!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf they are underestimating me because\nI'm old... Grrr!
Thank you very much for\nsaving my grandchild.
Shut your trap!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you stay here quietly,\nwe won't be rough.
What do they hope to accomplish\nby occupying the island?\xF000븀\x0000\nWhat a sketchy group!
If I had known this island's secret\nearlier, I would've...\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat? No! Nothing!\nJust talking to myself!
What are they doing in this little\nmemorial park? There's nothing here\xF000븀\x0000\nbut an old lighthouse...
Too many people use Pokémon\nfor bad deeds!
This officer's Pokémon couldn't stand up\nto them!\xF000븀\x0000\nThat blasted Team Plasma!
I'm really glad a strong Trainer\nlike you is around!
Recently, I've been bored because\nthe number of tourists has decreased.
Two hundred years ago, an ultra-rich\nfamily bought this island and named it\xF000븀\x0000\nLiberty Garden.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's a place where people and Pokémon\ncould live freely.
Dock 2\nTo board the tour boat, go to Dock 1.
This lighthouse shines with the light\nof freedom.\xF000븁\x0000\nOnly authorized personnel may enter.
My fellow officers rushed here by\npolice boat!\xF000븁\x0000\nThanks to them, we rounded up\nthese baddies!
How's that Pokémon doing?\xF000븁\x0000\nThe island sure has been quiet since\nthat incident.
Team Plasma forever!
We won't give up!
You're irredeemable!
Get moving!
Professor Juniper: Thanks to you,\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, this group that was\xF000븀\x0000\nup to no good has been captured!\xF000븁\x0000
Victini is a mythical Pokémon that is said\nto radiate energy from its body...\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen Pokémon or people come into contact\nwith that energy, it fills up their bodies,\xF000븀\x0000\nand they exhibit more power than usual.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's why there was no end to the\npeople who wanted to use Victini for\xF000븀\x0000\ntheir own evil ends...\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm sure the rich person who built this\nunderground room for Victini was\xF000븀\x0000\nsincerely trying to help it.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut I think shutting the poor thing up in\nthis room was a mistake.\xF000븁\x0000\nThanks to you, Victini has a new destiny\nthat does not involve being used in\xF000븀\x0000\nTeam Plasma's schemes.\xF000븁\x0000\nMaking sure no one misuses Victini's\npowers is now your duty!\xF000븁\x0000
Also...\xF000븁\x0000\nIn the Unova Pokédex, Victini was\nassigned a special number: zero.\xF000븁\x0000\nI've heard the special number was\nassigned in the hope that Victini's power\xF000븀\x0000\nto bring victory would be shared with the\xF000븀\x0000\nTrainer who travels with this Pokédex...\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper!\xF000븁\x0000\nWe cornered the crooks with our\nhigh-speed police boat!\xF000븁\x0000\nWe will return to Castelia City!\nPlease come on board, too!\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: Thank you!\nI'll be right there!\xF000븁\x0000
I can't believe it when people are led\nastray by Pokémon's astounding abilities\xF000븀\x0000\nand try to misuse them...\xF000븁\x0000\nBut it's only when we face Pokémon with a\ngood heart that we can make a\xF000븀\x0000\nbrighter future!\xF000븁\x0000
