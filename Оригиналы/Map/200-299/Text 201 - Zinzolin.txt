Zinzolin: All of you--huddle around me!\nI can't take this cold...\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Whatever.\nI can't believe you were really hiding.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's a bother, but if you're cold,\nshall I show you outside?\xF000븁\x0000
Zinzolin: Pokémon are our king's friends.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhile we're taking care of them, we can't\nlet any harm come to them here.\xF000븁\x0000\nEveryone, drive these intruders away!\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Understood,\nZinzolin of the Seven Sages!\xF000븁\x0000\nPut 'em up, 'cause here we come!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\nLet's each take care of one side!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, you take\ncare of those guys over there!
Team Plasma: I'm one of the tougher\nmembers of Team Plasma here!\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: How am I supposed to win\nwhen I'm shaking 'cause of the cold?
Team Plasma: S-s-so cold...\nHow can I win when I'm shivering so hard?\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: For this group,\nI'm pretty strong. I hope you know that!\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: In the middle of the night,\nwe gathered all the Pokémon we stole\xF000븀\x0000\nin front of the container, so we could\xF000븀\x0000\ntransport them all at the same time.\xF000븁\x0000\nThen Clay, that old guy, found us.\nWe had been captured!

Team Plasma: In this group,\nI'm fairly strong, and that's a fact!\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: The Pokémon that work\nwith people may look like they're having\xF000븀\x0000\nfun, but the truth is they're suffering.\xF000븁\x0000\nThere's no doubt about it!

Team Plasma: In my own way, I'm a strong\npart of this Team Plasma group!\xF000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Hmm-mmm... I wonder why...\nI'm getting sleepy for some reason.
Team Plasma: I wonder why...\nI'm getting sleepy for some reason.\xF000븁\x0000

Team Plasma: Um.\nRunning into the Cold Storage,\xF000븀\x0000\nthinking it was a regular container...\xF000븀\x0000\nHow cold life can be...
Team Plasma: Me?\nLosing to a Trainer like this?!
Team Plasma: Achoo! Why did I end up\nhere when I'm allergic to the cold!
Clay: Well, I'll be!\xF000븁\x0000\nHidin' in a chilly old place like this...\xF000븁\x0000
You guys take these\nPokémon robbers!\xF000븁\x0000
Worker: Roger!\xF000븁\x0000
Come on!
Eek!
Ugh!
Clay: You guys ain't so bad!\xF000븁\x0000\nYup, a promise is a promise.\nCome on an' challenge my Gym!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Whatever...\nTeam Plasma's ideal...\xF000븁\x0000\nSeparating people and Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's exactly the same as not having\nPokémon in this world at all.\xF000븀\x0000\nThat bunch is a waste of oxygen.\xF000븁\x0000\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000...\nIt's cold, so I'm getting out of here.\xF000븁\x0000
Zinzolin: So, you returned?\nYou're an odd Trainer.\xF000븁\x0000\nAll right. I've got time enough\nto satisfy your curiosity.\xF000븁\x0000
...Breathing.\nHaving a heart that beats.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat is simple existence and\nnothing more for a living being.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat may be the definition of living,\nbut I don't think that defines life.\xF000븁\x0000
The experiences of joy and suffering\nare a vital part of being alive.\xF000븁\x0000\nGhetsis gave me the sensation\nof being truly alive...\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat did he mean to accomplish?\nThat isn't what's important.\xF000븁\x0000
Right now, I'm shivering.\nI'm suffering, but I'm alive.\xF000븁\x0000
Pokémon and people live by being\ntogether and relying on one another.\xF000븀\x0000\nThat might be how you feel.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf that's so, is it necessary to\nseparate people and Pokémon?\xF000븁\x0000\nBy talking to you, I've discovered that\nthere's much I need to think about...\xF000븁\x0000\nI wish I had more to give you in thanks...\nHere, take this.\xF000븁\x0000
Zinzolin: My lord N said that he wanted\nto make Pokémon perfect...\xF000븁\x0000\nBut, even if the relationship between\nPokémon and people stayed as it now is,\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon can aspire to perfection...\xF000븁\x0000
Looker: Indeed! I am an officer of the\nInternational Police, and I demand to\xF000븀\x0000\nhear all you know about Team Plasma!\xF000븁\x0000
Zinzolin: It's too cold and I'm already\ntired of shivering in here.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you'll give me some time to think,\nI'll tell you what I know.\xF000븀\x0000\nSo...take me with you.\xF000븁\x0000
Looker: Thanks many times over!\xF000븁\x0000\nNow, Ghetsis notwithstanding, there\nyet remains but \xF000Ȁ\x0001\x0000 of the\xF000븀\x0000\nSeven Sages still at large.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe thoughts they are contemplating,\nthe hopes they are anticipating,\xF000븀\x0000\nthese--these are what I want to know!\xF000븀\x0000\nUntil our next meeting!\xF000븁\x0000
Looker: Thank you!\xF000븁\x0000\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, of something we must speak.\xF000븁\x0000\nA report has reached my ears of someone\nfar from here. Indeed, this someone\xF000븀\x0000\nhas spotted a person like N and a...\xF000븀\x0000\ndragon Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nI plan to examine the exactitude\nof this information. \xF000븀\x0000\nI hope to see you again!\xF000븁\x0000
