Cheren: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000\nSince we both hold the Jet Badge now,\nlet's see which of us is stronger!\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: That was a fine Pokémon battle!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm happy to see you are both growing\nas Trainers!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: If it isn't the Champion, Alder.\nI'm weak, so I lost!\xF000븁\x0000\n...And, honestly, it bothers me when you\ncall it a fine battle despite that.\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: Oh, honestly, Cheren.\xF000븁\x0000\nJust accept the compliment without the\nstinging remark.\xF000븁\x0000\nI've asked you this before, but what do\nyou plan to do after becoming strong?\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: If I get strong and become a\nChampion, that will be the reason for\xF000븀\x0000\nmy existence.\xF000븀\x0000\nI want to prove that I'm really living.\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: Hmmm...\nYou remind me of Marshal.\xF000븁\x0000\nOf course, having something you want\nto become is important.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut what is even more important is\nwhat you do with your newfound power.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnyway, take this!\xF000븁\x0000
Here--you, too.\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: If you use the move Surf, you can\ntravel over water.\xF000븁\x0000\nI shall see you again, young Trainers.\xF000븁\x0000\nDon't forget about the needs of the\nPokémon at your side!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: What I do with my power...\xF000븁\x0000\nI don't know that answer yet. First, I\nwant to become a strong Trainer so\xF000븀\x0000\neveryone will acknowledge that power!\xF000븁\x0000
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000...\nNext time, I will win!\xF000븁\x0000
You are \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, aren't you?\xF000븁\x0000\nAre you surprised that I know?\nClay told me.\xF000븁\x0000\nUh-oh! To go inside Twist Mountain,\nyou need to have a Gym Badge from the\xF000븀\x0000\nMistralton Gym!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe wild Pokémon here are tougher, and\nwe want to be sure you're ready!
Twist Mountain ahead.\nWatch out for wild Pokémon.
