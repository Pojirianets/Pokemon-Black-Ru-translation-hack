Bianca: Hey, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000
Cedric: Oh, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd you must be Bianca.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm the other Professor Juniper.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe Professor Juniper who gave you\nthe Pokédex is my daughter.\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Nice to meet you, professor!\xF000븁\x0000\nThanks to Professor Juniper,\nI got to go on a journey and start\xF000븀\x0000\nfiguring out possibilities for my life.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm very, very grateful to her!\xF000븁\x0000
Cedric: Is that right? Grand, grand.\nActually, we should chat later.\xF000븁\x0000\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, Bianca,\nhere's the situation.\xF000븁\x0000\nSome members of Team Plasma--quite\na large group--broke through the\xF000븀\x0000\ntower wall and went inside.\xF000븁\x0000\nBrycen and that young man--\nI believe his name is Cheren--\xF000븀\x0000\nthe two of them went after\xF000븀\x0000\nTeam Plasma, but...\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Professor, what's the\nDragonspiral Tower?\xF000븁\x0000
Cedric: Ha! I guess you would be curious.\nWell, I'll explain briefly.\xF000븁\x0000\nDragonspiral Tower has stood tall since\nlong before Unova was founded.\xF000븁\x0000\nOn the top floor, the legendary\nDragon-type Pokémon waits for\xF000븀\x0000\na person seeking truth to appear...\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's what is said.\xF000븁\x0000
Cedric: Ha! I guess you would be curious.\nWell, I'll explain briefly.\xF000븁\x0000\nDragonspiral Tower has stood tall since\nlong before Unova was founded.\xF000븁\x0000\nOn the top floor, the legendary\nDragon-type Pokémon waits for\xF000븀\x0000\na person pursuing ideals to appear...\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's what is said.\xF000븁\x0000
Are you going to go after Team Plasma\nlike your friend did?\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's admirable of you to join the fight\nagainst Team Plasma, but it's risky, too.\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Don't worry!\xF000븁\x0000\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 and Cheren are both\nreally, really strong, and they've\xF000븀\x0000\nbeaten Team Plasma before.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut...I'm not all that strong, actually.\nI admit it. I'm not very strong, so\xF000븀\x0000\nI was thinking...\xF000븁\x0000\nIt would be nice if, maybe, I could...\nStay here and be your bodyguard?\xF000븁\x0000
Cedric: Why, thank you!\nThat makes me feel much safer!\xF000븁\x0000\nWell, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\nIt's up to you! Climb the tower!\xF000븁\x0000


This is all I can give you,\nbut it might help you rest!\xF000븁\x0000
Cedric: Still...\nWhat could Team Plasma be after?\xF000븁\x0000
Cedric: Still...\nWhat could Team Plasma be after?
Bianca: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000...\nPlease don't do anything crazy.











Cedric: Astounding...\xF000븁\x0000\nI never would have imagined the legendary\nDragon-type Pokémon would return now...\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: That guy called N...\xF000븁\x0000\nTeam Plasma's boss apparently\nreawakened the legendary Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nHe told \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 to look for the other\nlegendary Pokémon, then flew away...\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Huh?\xF000븁\x0000\nThere are two legendary\nDragon-type Pokémon?\xF000븁\x0000
???: Yes! Yes, there are!\xF000븁\x0000
Cedric: Why, if it isn't Alder!\nIt's been a while! Have you been well?\xF000븁\x0000

Alder: No time for chitchat!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat fearsome column of fire that\nshot from the tower...\xF000븁\x0000\nThat Pokémon has the power to\ndestroy the world!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf it's on Team Plasma's side, and\nTeam Plasma tells everyone\xF000븀\x0000\nto release their Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000\nNo matter whether it comes from fear\nor admiration...\xF000븁\x0000\nThe world can't help but change.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt will become a world where we are\nseparated from Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: No time for chitchat!\xF000븁\x0000\nThose violent flashes of lightning\nthat shot from the tower...\xF000븁\x0000\nThat Pokémon has the power to\ndestroy the world!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf it's on Team Plasma's side, and\nTeam Plasma tells everyone\xF000븀\x0000\nto release their Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000\nNo matter whether it comes from fear\nor admiration...\xF000븁\x0000\nThe world can't help but change.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt will become a world where we are\nseparated from Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000
Cedric: Right...\xF000븁\x0000\nMoreover, the boss of Team Plasma,\nN, who reawakened Reshiram,\xF000븀\x0000\napparently said to look for the\xF000븀\x0000\nother Pokémon, Zekrom.\xF000븁\x0000
Cedric: Right...\xF000븁\x0000\nMoreover, the boss of Team Plasma,\nN, who reawakened Zekrom,\xF000븀\x0000\napparently said to look for the\xF000븀\x0000\nother Pokémon, Reshiram.\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: If I remember the myth,\nReshiram's fiery breath,\xF000븀\x0000\nalong with the other Pokémon,\xF000븀\x0000\ndevastated ancient Unova in an instant.\xF000븁\x0000\nEven knowing that, N is still\nwanting to awaken the other?!\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: If I remember the myth,\nZekrom's powerful electricity,\xF000븀\x0000\nalong with the other Pokémon,\xF000븀\x0000\ndevastated ancient Unova in an instant.\xF000븁\x0000\nEven knowing that, N is still\nwanting to awaken the other?!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: H-huh?!\xF000븁\x0000\nIsn't it dangerous to bring back\na Pokémon that powerful?\xF000븁\x0000
Alder: Miss, you are a very kind person.\xF000븁\x0000\nStill, I don't know if other Pokémon\nwill be able to stand up to it.\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause, no matter what,\nit is a legendary being...\xF000븁\x0000\nI don't like the idea of taking orders\nfrom N, but searching for the dragon--\xF000븀\x0000\nthe stone--might not be a bad plan.\xF000븁\x0000\nWe certainly can't let Team Plasma\nreawaken both of them!\xF000븁\x0000\nSince I've traveled all over Unova,\nI have an idea of where it might be.\xF000븁\x0000\nLet's head to the Relic Castle.\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, everyone, I'm going!\xF000븁\x0000
Cedric: I see. We'll leave that to you.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm going to investigate inside the tower.\nHopefully, I'll find something.\xF000븁\x0000
Brycen: Then, I will go with you.\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: I think I understand better now.\xF000븁\x0000\nBeing able to do something for Pokémon--\nfor somebody at a time like this--is\xF000븀\x0000\nstrength... I'm sure of it.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd my strength is something that is\ngiven to me by Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nOK, Champion, let's hurry!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000,\nthis has turned into a big deal.\xF000븁\x0000\nSo confusing... I dunno what to do...\xF000븁\x0000\nAre you gonna go to the\nRelic Castle, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000?\xF000븁\x0000\nPast Route 4, in the Desert Resort...\nI hear that's where the Relic Castle is...
Bianca: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000,\nlook for the Desert Resort past Route 4.\xF000븀\x0000\nI hear that's where the Relic Castle is...
