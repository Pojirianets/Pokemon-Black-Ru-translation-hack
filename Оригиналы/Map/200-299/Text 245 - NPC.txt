This is a secret room meant\nto hide Victini!\xF000븁\x0000\nTwo hundred years ago, a certain rich\nperson bought this entire island and hid\xF000븀\x0000\nVictini in this underground room.\xF000븁\x0000\nAfter that, no one saw Victini, and it\nbecame a mythical Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000
We, Team Plasma, will liberate Victini\nfrom this room and use its powers to make\xF000븀\x0000\nour goal a reality!\xF000븁\x0000\nWe won't let a brat like you get in\nour way!\xF000븁\x0000
It looks like I underestimated\nyour strength.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut Victini won't be so simple!\nLook!\xF000븁\x0000
Looks like it's waiting to test your\nstrength. You'd better get ready!
Living with Victini means accepting\nVictini's cruel destiny...\xF000븁\x0000\nSomeday we will test you to see if you are\ntruly ready for that.\xF000븁\x0000
