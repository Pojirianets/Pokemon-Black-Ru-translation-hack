Let me see...\xF000븁\x0000\nOh, you've caught \xF000Ȃ\x0001\x0000 Pokémon in the\nUnova region!
This Pokédex is full of memories from your\njourney. It's a treasure you can cherish\xF000븀\x0000\nfor your entire life.
If you want to meet more Pokémon, you\nshould try walking through tall grass!\xF000븁\x0000
It seems a little more like a Pokédex now!\nYou're getting off to a good start!\xF000븁\x0000
Some Pokémon are hard to find, but don't\ngive up! Keep checking the tall grass.\xF000븁\x0000
Some Pokémon are only found in\ncertain caves!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou might want to go back and search\ncaves you've already passed through.\xF000븁\x0000
Trainers have a lot of different Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nSo battling them is a great way to fill up\nyour Pokédex, too!\xF000븁\x0000
Wow, it's getting really full!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm sure looking over your Pokédex will\nbring back memories of your journey.\xF000븁\x0000
Over 100 Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's so much fun looking over all their\ndifferent characteristics!\xF000븁\x0000
That is an excellent Pokédex!\nJust a little more and it will be full!\xF000븁\x0000
What a wonderful Pokédex!\nA little more work, and it'll be complete!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm really glad I asked you to do this!\xF000븁\x0000
Amazing! Truly amazing!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou've met all of the Pokémon in the\nUnova region!\xF000븁\x0000\nCongratulations!\xF000븁\x0000\nNow here's your next challenge: see how\nmany of those Pokémon you can catch!\xF000븀\x0000\nI'll keep evaluating for you!\xF000븁\x0000
It seems like you are meeting Pokémon at\na good clip!\xF000븁\x0000\nI have something I want to give you!\nPlease come to the lab when you can.
It seems like you are meeting Pokémon at\na good clip!\xF000븁\x0000\nHere! This is a gift to thank you for all\nyour hard work!\xF000븁\x0000
False Swipe is a move that is very helpful\nfor catching Pokémon, because it keeps\xF000븀\x0000\nthe target from fainting!\xF000븁\x0000
Protect is a move that completely\nprevents an attack from hitting!\xF000븁\x0000\nWell, there are a few exceptions. Some\nmoves, like Feint, can still hit even if\xF000븀\x0000\nProtect is used.\xF000븁\x0000
Hidden Power is a mysterious move. Its\ntype and power change depending on the\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon that learns it!\xF000븁\x0000
Try using this, too!\xF000븁\x0000
Keep up the good work!
Little by little, more detailed information\nis being entered into the Pokédex!\xF000븀\x0000\nDo your best!\xF000븁\x0000
Are you trying out different kinds of\nPoké Balls for your captures?\xF000븁\x0000\nThey come in lots of varieties, so be sure\nto use the right one at the right time!\xF000븁\x0000
If you read the Pokédex descriptions,\nyou can learn a lot of unexpected facts\xF000븀\x0000\nabout Pokémon! It's fun!\xF000븁\x0000
Evolving Pokémon is another important\nway to fill up your Pokédex. It's not\xF000븀\x0000\njust about catching them!\xF000븁\x0000
Trading Pokémon with friends also\ncounts as catching them!\xF000븁\x0000
When you've met this many Pokémon, do\nyou have trouble picking which ones to\xF000븀\x0000\ntravel with?\xF000븁\x0000
This is a very thorough Pokédex.\nIt will help my research, too!\xF000븁\x0000
You've caught so many Pokémon.\nYou might know more than me now!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm rooting for you to complete\nyour Pokédex!\xF000븁\x0000
With just a little more effort, you will\ncomplete a perfect Pokédex!\xF000븀\x0000\nYou've come this far, so do your best!\xF000븁\x0000

So you're here to show me how your\nPokédex is coming along, right?
I see!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou've caught \xF000Ȃ\x0001\x0000 Pokémon, then...
Oh, really...\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you want me to have a look at\nyour Pokédex, come here again!
Nationally, there are more than\n600 Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou'll have to be persistent and\ncatch them at your own pace.
First, you might want to revisit places\nyou've already been.\xF000븁\x0000\nRetrace your steps in the Unova region\nand see what new Pokémon turn up!
Remember Rule No. 1! To catch a Pokémon,\nyou first have to reduce its HP.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou're pretty good at this now,\nbut don't forget the basics!
Are you going to the Day Care?\xF000븁\x0000\nI've heard that some Pokémon can only be\ncaught if they are hatched from Eggs.
Do you have a fishing rod?\xF000븁\x0000\nThere are many Pokémon that live in the\nwater. Try searching rivers and oceans!
Do you know the move False Swipe?\xF000븁\x0000\nFalse Swipe always leaves a tiny bit of\nthe targeted Pokémon's HP.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's great for catching, because it\ndoesn't make them faint!
Do you know the move Mean Look?\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you use Mean Look on a Pokémon,\nit can't run away!
There are several ways for Pokémon to\nevolve. Some Pokémon even evolve\xF000븀\x0000\nthrough friendship!
Have you heard of mass outbreaks?\xF000븁\x0000\nBig groups of Pokémon appear during a\nmass outbreak. It's a great chance to\xF000븀\x0000\ncatch them!
You've caught more than 400\ndifferent Pokémon?!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's incredible!\nYou're an amazing Trainer!
Apparently, some Pokémon\nevolve when they are leveled up\xF000븀\x0000\nin a certain area.
You've caught 500 different Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000\nMy, the variation of these beings called\nPokémon certainly is surprising!\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd the fact that you've caught so many\ndifferent kinds... That's pretty\xF000븀\x0000\nsurprising, too!
Have you been to the Poké Transfer Lab\non Route 15?\xF000븁\x0000\nMastering a facility like that is an\naccomplishment for a Pokémon Trainer.
Just a little more until you complete\nyour Pokédex, huh?\xF000븁\x0000\nCatching this many Pokémon must mean...\nYou really like Pokémon, don't you!
Oh! That's a wonderful Pokédex.\xF000븁\x0000\nHow about it? Would you research Pokémon\nwith me?
Oh! Just a little more until your\nPokédex is complete!\xF000븁\x0000\nMake sure you go after the roaming\nPokémon and trade with friends to get\xF000븀\x0000\nthe ones you're missing!
...\n...\xF000븁\x0000\nThis blows me away! It's so wonderful,\nI'm at a loss for words.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou... You've accomplished something\ntruly outstanding.\xF000븁\x0000\nFilling up the National Pokédex makes you\na Trainer among Trainers!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm so happy I was able to meet a\nfantastic Trainer like you!\xF000븀\x0000\nI thank you from the bottom of my heart.
