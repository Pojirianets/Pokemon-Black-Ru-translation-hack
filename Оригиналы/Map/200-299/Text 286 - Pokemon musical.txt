What's the Pokémon Musical?
The Pokémon Musical is a show where\nPokémon wearing Props perform on stage.\xF000븀\x0000\nAnyone can participate!\xF000븁\x0000\nWe encourage all Trainers to show the\nworld how charming their Pokémon are!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe audience is looking forward to seeing\nhow you Dress Up your Pokémon, and how\xF000븀\x0000\nyour Pokémon perform!\xF000븁\x0000
How to Participate
You can join the musical from any of the\nthree reception areas.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe reception area in the center is for\nparticipating alone.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen you participate alone, you will\nbe joined by other Trainers from around\xF000븀\x0000\nthe Unova region.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you want to put on a musical with your\nfriends, go to the left reception area.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou'll be asked to pick a Leader who\nwill choose which show to perform,\xF000븀\x0000\nand the others will join the group.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe reception area to the right is where\nyou go to Dress Up only.\xF000븁\x0000
Eligible Pokémon
The Pokémon that will participate in the\nmusical are chosen from your party at\xF000븀\x0000\nthe reception area.\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause of their shape, some Pokémon\nhave a hard time wearing certain Props.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou might want to try Dress Up in the\nchanging room first if you're worried!\xF000븁\x0000
Dress Up
Oh, Dress Up is my favorite part! That's\nwhere you put the Props you've collected\xF000븀\x0000\non the Pokémon that will be performing.\xF000븁\x0000\nDepending on the Pokémon, you can put\nthe Props in different places.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen you use Props that fit the theme of\nthe show you've chosen, the audience\xF000븀\x0000\nwill notice your Pokémon more!\xF000븁\x0000\nSometimes a Prop that doesn't fit the\ntheme will also make your Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nstand out.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you want to get an idea of how it's\ndone, you can watch how other people\xF000븀\x0000\nDress Up and then try it yourself!\xF000븁\x0000
Shows
You can choose which show to perform\nwhen you participate in the musical.\xF000븁\x0000\nThere is no need for Trainers to give\ncommands, but if your Pokémon is carrying\xF000븀\x0000\na Prop in its arms, it can use that Prop\xF000븀\x0000\nto show off and appeal to the audience.\xF000븁\x0000\nDepending on how you Dress Up your\nPokémon, the reactions from the audience\xF000븀\x0000\nwill change!\xF000븁\x0000
