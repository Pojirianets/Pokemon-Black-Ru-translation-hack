Oh, it's just a kid...\xF000븁\x0000
You... It couldn't be...\xF000븁\x0000\nThe fact that you are here means you\ncame to learn about the secret\xF000븀\x0000\nof Genesect!\xF000븁\x0000
We, Team Plasma, revived Genesect from\na Fossil.\xF000븁\x0000\nThen we enhanced the Pokémon with the\npower of science!\xF000븁\x0000
It is the strongest Pokémon in history!!\xF000븁\x0000
But, our lord N was not interested in\nthis Genesect that was modified by the\xF000븀\x0000\npower of science!\xF000븁\x0000
“Science damages the natural beauty\nof Pokémon! They're perfect beings!"\xF000븁\x0000
That's what he said...\xF000븁\x0000\nSo our research was halted, and this\nfacility was closed...\xF000븁\x0000
However!!\nThe Genesect research is all mine!\xF000븁\x0000\nSo if you want to know Genesect's\nsecret, you'll have to beat me in battle!\xF000븁\x0000
Battle the Scientist?
I've lost everything...\xF000븁\x0000\nI forgot my duty as a Scientist is\nto make the world happy.\xF000븁\x0000\nSo, this must be what I get for trying to\nmake a Pokémon into a tool for fighting...\xF000븁\x0000
I'm going to wash my hands of this\nGenesect matter...\xF000븁\x0000\nI don't need this anymore...\nI'll give it to you.\xF000븁\x0000
There was another one in my\nother pocket...\xF000븁\x0000
The item I just gave you was made\nfor Genesect.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen it holds an item like this, it\nchanges the type of the move called\xF000븀\x0000\nTechno Blast, so it can always have\xF000븀\x0000\nan advantage.\xF000븁\x0000
There sure are some very cowardly\nTrainers, aren't there!
So you want to battle me?!
I've given you all of the Drives.\nUse them how you wish...
There is a memo stuck to the\nside of the monitor.\xF000븁\x0000\nRead it?
My lord N apparently rejected\nmy research...\xF000븁\x0000\nBut my research is necessary for\nTeam Plasma to reach its goal...\xF000븀\x0000\nThe strongest Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000\nThe rest of the memo is torn and\nimpossible to read.
