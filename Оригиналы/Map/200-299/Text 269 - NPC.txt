Sometimes, above the bridge, you can\nsee the shadows of bird Pokémon, right?\xF000븁\x0000\nTheir feathers drift to the ground here!\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd when you try to pick them up,\noccasionally, you'll run into a Pokémon.
When a ship passes, the bridge raises\nand lowers.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut Clay controls when the ships run\nfrom the start, so when the bridge\xF000븀\x0000\nraises and lowers is up to Clay.
When Driftveil is mentioned, what comes\nto mind is the Cold Storage...\xF000븀\x0000\nand Charles!
