In battles, striking first is essential!\nSo, here!\xF000븁\x0000
If you give it to a Pokémon to hold,\nmaybe it will let that Pokémon use its\xF000븀\x0000\nmove before its opponent can.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's what I gave you.\nIt's called Quick Claw!
There are people who are obsessed with\ncertain items.\xF000븁\x0000\nThey'll even buy your items for a lot\nof money!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou might even be able to sell items you\ncan't use to these people, so maybe you\xF000븀\x0000\nshould hang on to them.
