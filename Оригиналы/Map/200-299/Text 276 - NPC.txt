I will look for a new start!\nPatrat and I can do it together!\xF000븁\x0000\nThank you, Village Bridge, for making us\nwho we are...and farewell!\xF000븁\x0000
Swonweeya!
Doesn't this house have\ngreat atmosphere?
Doesn't this entire room kind of smell\nlike Patrat?
Isn't it great that this house is on\nthe bridge?
Hmmm...\xF000븁\x0000\nI am a bit concerned about the guy\nsinging outside...
We can move in here right away?!
This place isn't bad, but I'd prefer a\nnice big villa in Undella Town!
