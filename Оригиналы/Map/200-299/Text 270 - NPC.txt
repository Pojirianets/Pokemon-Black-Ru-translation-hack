...\xF000븁\x0000\n...Come.\xF000븁\x0000
...\xF000븁\x0000\nGhetsis. We brought the one you wanted.\xF000븁\x0000

Ghetsis: Excellent. It seems that\nyou have obtained the Light Stone.\xF000븁\x0000\nI congratulate you on a job well done.\xF000븁\x0000
It is my lord N's thought that the two\nholders of the legendary Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nshould put their beliefs on the line\xF000븀\x0000\nand strive to find which is the true hero.\xF000븁\x0000
This is not necessary, however.\xF000븁\x0000\nFrom his infancy, I provided him with the\neducation required to become the hero\xF000븀\x0000\nof legend. Indeed, he has been so\xF000븀\x0000\nacknowledged by the legendary Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\n...Such purity of purpose is his.\xF000븁\x0000
The liberation of Pokémon of which I... Of\nwhich Team Plasma speaks is the\xF000븀\x0000\nseparation of Pokémon from\xF000븀\x0000\nfoolish people!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's the truth! All Trainers will become\nhelpless to resist us!\xF000븁\x0000\nWe alone will be able to use Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
The preparations are complete!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen my perfect plan is set in motion,\nfirst a few gullible Pokémon Trainers who\xF000븀\x0000\nare unable to resist Team Plasma will\xF000븀\x0000\nrelease their Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nThen that number will become a hundred,\nthen a thousand...\xF000븁\x0000\nIn no time, even the Gym Leaders and the\nChampion will become unable to fight us.\xF000븁\x0000\nHaving a Pokémon will be considered\na bad thing!\xF000븁\x0000\nEven people like the sad little Bianca,\nwhose Pokémon was stolen in Castelia,\xF000븀\x0000\nwill be unable to face public opinion\xF000븀\x0000\nand will release their Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's the kind of world we'll make!\xF000븁\x0000
You may have the Stone, but there's no\nchance whatsoever that the legendary\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon will accept you as the hero.\xF000븁\x0000\nSo, if you're not willing to hand over\nyour precious Pokémon, I suggest you\xF000븀\x0000\nsearch for some courage--\xF000븀\x0000\nbecause you're going to need it!\xF000븁\x0000
When I was running around trying\nto outrun the trains,\xF000븀\x0000\nI got overheated. Phew!\xF000븁\x0000\nAnyway, please take this!\xF000븁\x0000
