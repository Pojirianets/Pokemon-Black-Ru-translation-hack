Cheren: I'm very sorry about\nall the trouble, ma'am.\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Well, um...\nWe can clean up...\xF000븁\x0000
Mom: Cleaning up?\nNo worries. I'll take care of it later.\xF000븁\x0000\nShouldn't you be on your way to\nmeet Professor Juniper?\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Yes, thank you!\nPlease excuse us.\xF000븁\x0000\nCome on.\nLet's go thank Professor Juniper.\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: I'll be waiting in front of\nthe Pokémon Research Lab.\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Oh! Wait!\nI've gotta go home first.\xF000븁\x0000
Thanks for having us over!\xF000븁\x0000
Mom: My, my, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xF000븁\x0000\nPokémon battles are so lively,\naren't they?\xF000븁\x0000\nI could hear the Pokémon's\ncries clear down here!\xF000븁\x0000
Hm. That sure reminded me of\nmy first Pokémon battle!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, and you know? After a battle,\nyou need to rest your Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon is looking great!\xF000븁\x0000\nNow, if you're going out,\ndon't forget your “cross-transceiver"!\xF000븁\x0000
You're going to thank the\nprofessor too, right?\xF000븀\x0000\nBetter get going, honey!
Mom: Phew! I'm taking a little break\nfrom cleaning up.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou and your Pokémon should take\na break, too.\xF000븁\x0000\nGood Trainers don't push their\nPokémon too hard.\xF000븁\x0000
Mom: You and your Pokémon should all be\nfilled with energy again!\xF000븀\x0000\nNow, you can go anywhere!
Mom: I wonder where you'll go next\nand what kind of Pokémon you'll meet.
Mom: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\nHow are your Pokémon?\xF000븁\x0000\nYou should rest a little!\xF000븁\x0000\nGood Trainers don't push\ntheir Pokémon too hard.\xF000븁\x0000
Mom: Great! You and your Pokémon\nlook raring to go, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xF000븁\x0000\nBest get back to your journey!
Mom: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000,\nare you being kind to your Pokémon?\xF000븁\x0000\nPokémon work so hard to help you out!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou're normally very kind to your\nPokémon, aren't you?
Mom: Now that you mention it...\xF000븁\x0000\nYour father went on a journey\nwith Pokémon, just as you are!\xF000븁\x0000\nWe met during his trip...
Mom: How are things going?\xF000븁\x0000\nHave you caught many Pokémon?\nThat was the professor's request, right?
Mom: I wonder what Cheren and Bianca\nwill find during their travels.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat they really want from life...\xF000븁\x0000\nIf they figure that out for themselves,\nI think their journeys will prove to be\xF000븀\x0000\nall they could hope for!
Mom: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\nWelcome home!\xF000븁\x0000\nSounds like you've been through a lot!\nYou should rest a little bit!\xF000븁\x0000
Mom: Oh, my!\nYou and your Pokémon look full of bounce!\xF000븁\x0000\nThis is just a little advice from your\nmother, but...\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen a Pokémon's energy--um, I mean,\nHP--runs out, hurry to a Pokémon Center\xF000븀\x0000\nand get it restored.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's also a good idea to buy Potions\nat a Pokémon Mart for times when you're\xF000븀\x0000\nadventuring far from civilization.\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease be careful!\nHave a good trip!\xF000븀\x0000\nI'll always be cheering for you!
“Mom": Welcome home, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xF000븁\x0000\nSeems like you've been through\nmany amazing things, is it not so?\xF000븁\x0000
“Mom": Incredible, really.\xF000븁\x0000\nAmazing, absolutely, meeting these\ntwo Pokémon of legend!\xF000븁\x0000
“Mom": Ah, ah, this is...\xF000븁\x0000
“Mom": Oh!\nI still wear my disguise! Pardon!\xF000븁\x0000\nOr, rather, let me introduce myself.\xF000븁\x0000
I am a globe-trotting elite of the\nInternational Police.\xF000븁\x0000\nMy name... Ah, no, I shall inform you\nof my code name only.\xF000븁\x0000\nMy code name, it is Looker.\nIt is how I am called!\xF000븁\x0000
Looker: Behind the scenes in this region\nof Unova, an organization called\xF000븀\x0000\nTeam Plasma conspires...\xF000븁\x0000\nThis I have heard, and therefore,\nto this region I must come, but...\xF000븁\x0000
Thanks to the Gym Leaders and to you,\nyes, Team Plasma's castle has fallen.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd the members, they have gone upon\ntheir separate ways!\xF000븀\x0000\nThis is what I hear, most certainly!\xF000븁\x0000
But, however!\nHowever, but...\xF000븁\x0000\nThe ones known as the Seven Sages--still,\nthey hide themselves in the Unova region.\xF000븁\x0000
And so, in the end, it explains why I must\nask this of you, Trainer of amazing skill!\xF000븁\x0000\nTravel the Unova region and search it up\nand search it down for the Seven Sages!\xF000븁\x0000\nAlder, the Champion of renown,\nrecommended you to my notice.\xF000븁\x0000\nAre you willing to help me?
Ah, ah!\xF000븁\x0000\nYet once more shall I ask!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you please, travel the Unova region\nand search it low and high for these\xF000븀\x0000\nSeven Sages!
Looker: Excellent! I thank you!\xF000븁\x0000\nNow I feel as if I have perhaps \na million people on my side.\xF000븁\x0000\nPermit me to give this into your hands!\xF000븁\x0000
Mom: ...That's a Super Rod, right?\xF000븁\x0000
Looker: Yes, correct!\nIt is certainly a Super Rod!\xF000븁\x0000
Mom: Weren't we talking about\nTeam Plasma's Seven Sages?\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat does this have to do with\nlooking for those people?\xF000븁\x0000
Looker: I see.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt is truly \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000's mama to ask so!\nWhat a magnificent question! I admire it.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt is my pleasure to answer.\xF000븁\x0000\nAbsolutely nothing!\xF000븁\x0000
...

Mom: I see...\xF000븁\x0000
Looker: Yes, I shall provide the\nexplanation of this, the Super Rod!\xF000븁\x0000\nFirst!\nFace the water and employ the rod!\xF000븁\x0000\nSecond!\nConcentrate your focal point!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen it occurs that these Pokémon bite,\n“!" will indicate. Immediately, reel in!\xF000븁\x0000\nFor the rest, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000,\nI depend upon you!\xF000븁\x0000
Mom: People from the International\nPolice are kind of...unique, aren't they?\xF000븁\x0000\nWell, no worries. I think you should just\ndo what you want to do.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou're practically a grown-up now!
