A beautiful tune is spreading\nthroughout the town...
Anville Town\nRolling Out the Steel Rails
It's a subway map of the Unova region.\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, are you also curious about\nthat train?
Unfortunately, no train has\ncome here today.\xF000븁\x0000
See the train there?
All righty!\nLet me explain!\xF000븁\x0000
All righty!\nAll aboard!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, that's a shame.\xF000븁\x0000
Hahaha!\nYou're right.\xF000븁\x0000
Today's train car is a Hyperspeed Train!\nIt runs faster than a rocket!\xF000븀\x0000\nIt runs quieter than an air conditioner!
This is a Single Train! It's the oldest\ntrain in the Battle Subway.
This Super Single Train is\na new mass-produced car!
This car is a Double Train!\nThis is a mass-produced car\xF000븀\x0000\nfrom a decade ago!
This Super Double Train is\na new mass-produced car!
This car is a Multi Train!\nFew cars of this model were produced.
This train car is a Super Multi Train!\nThis is the latest train car!
This train car is a Wi-Fi Train!\nIt is the fastest long-distance\xF000븀\x0000\nhigh-speed train in the Battle Subway!
As you know, this is a local train to\nAnville Town! Isn't it just so cute?
This train car is the kind that ran\na long time ago.
This train car is a new train\nto run in the future!
I can see!\nI can see it!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat lovely smooth curve! Ah, I wish\nI could reach out and touch it!
It's for a loop line to go around the\nUnova region!
It's an environmentally friendly train,\nbecause they revised all the parts\xF000븀\x0000\nto drastically reduce power consumption!
Compared to a Single Train,\nthe number of parts was reduced\xF000븀\x0000\nso it could be built for a lower cost.
Such a streamlined and refined design!\nBeauty and utility working together!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat kind of beautility is unique to\nmass-produced train cars!
This is a test car to develop future\nmass-produced cars that will replace\xF000븀\x0000\nthe old Double Trains.
Improved acceleration and deceleration!\nAutomated train-car controls!\xF000븀\x0000\nIt's full of cutting-edge technologies.
This is called a pendulum car.\nIts body tilts while going around curves,\xF000븀\x0000\nso it can run without slowing down!
This one is a little slow and heavy.\nWhen it runs, the whole train sways.
Compared to contemporary train cars, it\nhas more parts, so I heard it was\xF000븀\x0000\ndifficult to build.
Wooo! Cool! Super cool!\nThe latest motor breathes fire!
I can see it so clearly! But I cannot\ntouch the Hyperspeed Train!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt really is hyper technology!\xF000븁\x0000\nAs you can see, we engineers are\nalways seriously dreaming that someday\xF000븀\x0000\nthe dream will become a reality!\xF000븁\x0000
Do you know Tubeline Bridge?\xF000븁\x0000\nThe train that runs on it is\nthis Single Train.\xF000븁\x0000
Newer trains have to be built\nin a way that's both functional\xF000븀\x0000\nand environmentally friendly.\xF000븁\x0000\nCompared to the past, they've\nimproved significantly.\xF000븁\x0000
The number of parts influences the\nbudget and construction time.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe streamlined and beautiful design\nof the Double Train is still valued today.\xF000븁\x0000
It uses the same train car\nas a Super Single Train.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe only difference is the appearance.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt is a superb train car that will go down\nin the history of the Battle Subway!\xF000븁\x0000
The technology born during the creation\nof this train car made the Super Single\xF000븀\x0000\nTrain and Super Double Train possible!\xF000븁\x0000
Also, a regeneration brake system,\na car-body tilting system,\xF000븀\x0000\na whatchamacallit system,\xF000븀\x0000\na thingamabob system...\xF000븁\x0000\nI don't remember all the details,\nbut it's just a big festival of all\xF000븀\x0000\nthe latest technology!\xF000븁\x0000
Faster! Farther!\nOur engineers' spirits are infused in it!\xF000븁\x0000
The train car is the same model as a\nSingle Train.\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause it is an old train car, I hear the\nmaintenance is hard, but it's the one I\xF000븀\x0000\nalways ride, because I loved it as a kid!\xF000븁\x0000
The old train cars built with lots of small\nparts have their own unique beauty and\xF000븀\x0000\nattract a lot of fans.\xF000븁\x0000\nThose cars no longer run in the\nBattle Subway, but I hear they're still\xF000븀\x0000\nused in a faraway region.\xF000븁\x0000\nAh... I'd love to be on that train!\xF000븁\x0000
Uh-oh, if it really breathed fire, that\nwould be bad!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut it is full of the latest technologies!\nIt's undergoing a lot of testing.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's called a gauge-convertible train.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's a sweet car that can adjust its\nwheels to run on any rail!\xF000븁\x0000
A train to Nimbasa City is leaving\nthe station shortly.\xF000븁\x0000\nWould you like to board?
Then, please get on the train and wait.\xF000븁\x0000
This is a quiet town!\nRelax and stay for a while.
Gave the \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0000 in exchange for\nthe \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0002!
Ah... I'm in trouble.\xF000븁\x0000\nI was so engrossed in my trip that I ran\nout of \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0000.\xF000븁\x0000\nLet me see...\nWill you trade your \xF000ȁ\x0001\x0001 \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0000\xF000븀\x0000\nfor my \xF000ȁ\x0001\x0003 \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0002?
Will you trade your \xF000ȁ\x0001\x0001 \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0000\nfor my \xF000ȁ\x0001\x0003 \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0002?
Great, let's trade!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, that's a shame.
Hehe! It was a delightful trade,\nwasn't it?
...Uh-oh. You don't have\nenough \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0000s.
...Uh-oh. You don't have enough room for\nthe \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0002.
I am a \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0000 collector!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou, over there! Let's have a\nbusinesslike exchange.\xF000븁\x0000\nWill you trade your \xF000ȁ\x0001\x0001 \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0000 for\nmy \xF000ȁ\x0001\x0003 \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0002?
Will you trade your \xF000ȁ\x0001\x0001 \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0000\nfor my \xF000ȁ\x0001\x0003 \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0002?
Excellent. Let's do business!\xF000븁\x0000
Why? Do you think this is a bad deal?
Hah! It was a mutually beneficial trade!\nThis is a win-win relationship, right?
Hah! You don't have\nany \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0000s.
Hah! You don't have enough room for\nthe \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0002.
With that face, I bet you have\nsomething I want.\xF000븁\x0000\nWill you trade your \xF000ȁ\x0001\x0001 \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0000 for\nmy \xF000ȁ\x0001\x0003 \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0002?

Yay!\nThen, let's trade!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, it seems I was mistaken...
Ooh-la-la! This luster!\nI really like \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0000s.\xF000븁\x0000\nAn experienced person like me can tell\nthe difference of the luster of each one!
Ooh-la-la!\nYou don't have enough \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0000s.
Ooh-la-la! You don't have room for\nthe \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0002.
It's so lively on weekends!\nOh, me? I came here to watch the trains.
You can trade lots of items.\nIt was surprisingly fun when I tried!
What delicious air!
I wanted to get a picture from\nthis angle!\xF000븁\x0000
Why do people love trains?\xF000븁\x0000\nMaybe it's the design, the way they can\nrun so fast and still be so comfortable.\xF000븁\x0000\nAll the essential parts work together...\nIt's simple but so beautiful!
Trains are so cooooool!\xF000븁\x0000\nMy mom brought me, but now she's\ntaking pictures somewhere.\xF000븁\x0000
On weekends, a lot of people come here\nto watch the trains.
They are full of people today, too.\nDo you also trade items?
This is a rare weekend when there aren't\nany trains.
A lot of train cars have a rest here.
If there are a lot of people,\nI feel that the trains are happy!
Today all the train cars are resting!
The girl on the bridge...\xF000븁\x0000\nShe's playing a lullaby for all the\nsleeping trains of this town.
