Lacunosa Town\nMethodical and Orderly
Welcome to Lacunosa Town.\xF000븁\x0000\nIn this town, people live as methodically\nas clockwork from morning to night.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you live your life soaking up sunlight,\nyou can sleep very well at night.
Well, hello there, young traveler!\xF000븁\x0000\nWould you like to hear an old story\nof Lacunosa Town?\xF000븁\x0000\nBear with me, because I'm an old lady who\nlikes telling tales the old-fashioned way!
There's a great big hole at the back\nof this town.\xF000븁\x0000\nA long time ago, a huge meteor fell from\nthe sky and made the big hole.\xF000븁\x0000\nA very scary monster was hiding\ninside the meteor!\xF000븁\x0000\nPeople say the monster appeared in the\nvillage at night, bringing a cold wind, and\xF000븀\x0000\nit stole away people and Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000\nSo the villagers built big walls to keep\nthe monster out and made a rule that\xF000븀\x0000\nno one could go out after dark.\xF000븁\x0000
...Of course, nowadays nobody believes in\nsuch things.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut you know...\xF000븁\x0000\nEven now, the people of this town\nstay inside after dark.\xF000븀\x0000\nIsn't that strange?\xF000븁\x0000\nI guess old stories and old traditions\nhave some influence on our current life.
Oh, well, that's too bad. Come talk to me\nif you're ever in the mood for a story!
At night, a scary monster comes out of\nthe big hole, so you have to go home\xF000븀\x0000\nand be good!
Along the road ahead, there is a\ncoastline that fishing fans love.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhirrrrr...plunk!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's the sound my fishing rod makes.\nI like to hear it every day!
My grandma loves to tell old stories.\xF000븁\x0000\nShe makes me listen to her long stories\nall the time!
There are a lot of people in the world,\nand there are just as many different\xF000븀\x0000\ncharacteristics and ideas.
I don't have anything to do ever since\nI took a post here.\xF000븁\x0000\nSince nobody goes outside at night,\nit's very peaceful.
Gahoo! Gahoo!
My Pokémon always goes out\nfor fun without me.
