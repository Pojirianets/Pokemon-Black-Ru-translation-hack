I found this plate when I used the move\nDive in the sea around Undella Town!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut I don't know how to use it.\nYou can have it if you like.\xF000븁\x0000
I have another one.\nTake this, too!\xF000븁\x0000
They say there's a sunken temple at the\nbottom of the sea around Undella Town.\xF000븁\x0000\nThose plates were resting in the temple.\nMaybe they're treasure...
