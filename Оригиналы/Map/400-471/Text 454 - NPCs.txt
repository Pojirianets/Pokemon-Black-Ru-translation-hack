Fun in summer...\nBeautiful girls playing in the water...\xF000븁\x0000\nHey! I'm just thinking out loud.\nPlease don't listen to me!
The best luxury is to enjoy\njust doing nothing.
Phew...\xF000븁\x0000\nI've been relaxing in Undella Town too\nlong, and I've gotten a little chubby.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf \xF000ā\x0001\x0000 is by my side, I can get\nsome exercise by training it, and\xF000븀\x0000\nthat'll help me lose weight.\xF000븁\x0000\nWould you trade my \xF000ā\x0001\x0001\nwith \xF000ā\x0001\x0000?
Phew! All right, let's trade!\xF000븁\x0000
Phew... Thanks.\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease take good care of \xF000ā\x0001\x0001.\nIt spent a summer with me.\xF000븁\x0000\nI will work hard to train your \xF000ā\x0001\x0000\nand get some exercise!
Phew... What I want is \xF000ā\x0001\x0000.
Phew... That's disappointing.
Hello, there!\nYou kindly traded me that Pokémon, and\xF000븀\x0000\nnow you can hardly recognize me, eh?\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause \xF000ā\x0001\x0000 is by my side,\nI've trimmed down a little!
