???: What's this?\xF000븁\x0000
What an uncanny resemblance...\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's surprising to meet another Trainer\nwho has intense eyes like that\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon Trainer.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat's your name?\xF000븁\x0000\n...\xF000븁\x0000\nOK. I'll remember that!\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, nice to meet you.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm Cynthia.\nI'm a Pokémon Trainer, too, like you.\xF000븁\x0000\nI have an insatiable curiosity for\nresearching Pokémon myths.\xF000븁\x0000
I'm sure you know about Undella Town's\nAbyssal Ruins, right?\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm staying here at my friend's villa\nso I can investigate them.\xF000븁\x0000
In order to get to know each other\nbetter as Pokémon Trainers,\xF000븀\x0000\nI would like our Pokémon to have a match.\xF000븁\x0000\nWould you care to be my opponent?
Before I send out my Pokémon,\nmy heart always begins to race...\xF000븁\x0000\nInteresting...\nMy Pokémon in their Poké Balls are\xF000븀\x0000\nradiating a happy feeling.\xF000븁\x0000\nAre you the reason?\nWhat are you?\xF000븁\x0000
Ha ha. You prefer to take things slowly\nand rationally, am I right?\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen you're ready, come and talk to me.\nI'll be happy to see you.
Cynthia: Oh.\nYou've had a chance to get ready?\xF000븁\x0000\nI do want our Pokémon to have a match...\nAre you prepared to be my opponent?
Cynthia: That was beyond my expectation!\nWhat an exceptional battle!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou certainly bear a resemblance\nto that Trainer who faced Giratina...\xF000븁\x0000\nOh, pardon me.\nI was just thinking out loud.\xF000븁\x0000\nI love being here in spring and summer.\xF000븁\x0000\nI can't stay all year, because there's\nso much to investigate in Sinnoh, as well.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou're a great Trainer, and it would make\nme happy to see you again sometime.
Cynthia: I love to come here in\nspring and summer.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut there are a lot of things to\ninvestigate in Sinnoh, as well.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'd be delighted to see you again.\nYou're an awesome Pokémon Trainer!
Cynthia: How terrific to see you again!\xF000븁\x0000\nI've got to tell you...\nMy Pokémon are excited to battle yours.\xF000븁\x0000\nWould you care to be my opponent?
Cynthia: This will be such fun!\nNo holds barred!\xF000븁\x0000
Cynthia: Oh, what a pity.\xF000븁\x0000\nSummers in Undella Town make me feel like\nI'm on holiday. I forget about battling!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut in spring, I feel like getting\nworked up with a good battle.
Cynthia: I can tell that my Pokémon are\nexcited about battling your Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000\nWould you care to be my opponent?
Cynthia: For some reason, this reminds me\nof a time when I told a Trainer like you\xF000븀\x0000\nto go see many, many more places\xF000븀\x0000\nand to meet many more Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nFor me, it has really been worthwhile to\ncome all the way to far Unova.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhy? Because...\nI met you, and my world got wider!
Cynthia: To live their lives to the\nfullest, people and Pokémon need\xF000븀\x0000\nthe chance to throw themselves into\xF000븀\x0000\nbattle against the fiercest opposition.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's why I want to battle you.\nHow about it?
Cynthia: As our Pokémon meet in battle,\nI'll learn more about you\xF000븀\x0000\nand how you've taken care of them.\xF000븁\x0000
Cynthia: I'm a little disappointed.\xF000븁\x0000\nI know you can battle on bigger\nstages than you've done so far!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's so plain to me that your light can\nshine brighter than this...
Cynthia: Are you prepared?\xF000븁\x0000\nLet's battle at full strength and see\nhow bright our lights can shine!
Cynthia: When you meet Trainers, battle\nthem to learn about the kind of people\xF000븀\x0000\nthey are. Observe the Pokémon they\xF000븀\x0000\nchoose, which moves they taught them,\xF000븀\x0000\nand which items the Pokémon hold.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou don't need words at such times...\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you want to know more about me...\nCome to Sinnoh!
Caitlin: Having everything go your way\nis the road to disillusionment.\xF000븁\x0000\nKnowing the difference between what's\nimpossible and what's possible...\xF000븁\x0000\nI used to know someone who \ntalked about that a lot.
Caitlin: No matter how hard I try,\nI cannot defeat Cynthia.\xF000븁\x0000\nBefore, I would have exploded with rage.\xF000븁\x0000\nNow, I have the tranquility to reflect on\nmy performance to see how I can improve.
Caitlin: Tell me something.\nAre you familiar with Battle Castles?\xF000븁\x0000\nYou can find them in Johto and Sinnoh,\nso challenge them to improve yourself.
Caitlin: This is my villa.\xF000븁\x0000\nI have villas all over the world,\nand I allow Cynthia to use them.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou are welcome to come and play\nwhenever you wish.
Caitlin: Having no psychic powers at all\nis better than having psychic powers\xF000븀\x0000\nyou can't control.
Shauntal: When I'm writing novels,\nif I don't have enough input,\xF000븀\x0000\nmy output suffers.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's the same thing for Trainers.\xF000븁\x0000\nTo grow stronger, Trainers need to have\ncountless battles and learn many things.\xF000븁\x0000\nThen, they must put what they've learned\nto the test in real battles.
Shauntal: Rainbow Wing...\nSilver Wing...\xF000븀\x0000\nThey stir the imagination!
Shauntal: Distortion World...\nand the single Pokémon found there...\xF000븀\x0000\nWhat an amazing scene!
Shauntal: No matter how much research\nI do, I still have no clue.\xF000븁\x0000\nHow old do you think Cynthia is?\nAny idea?
Shauntal: I chose my scarf with a\ncertain Pokémon in mind.\xF000븁\x0000\nDo you get it?\nUsing your imagination is important!
Cynthia: What is necessary for becoming\nstronger than you are now?\xF000븁\x0000\nMy answer is simply loving Pokémon\nwith all your heart.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's how I am, so that's all I can say.
Cynthia: Once every few years,\nthe Champions of each region gather\xF000븀\x0000\nand compete to see who is the strongest!\xF000븁\x0000\nAn interesting idea, don't you agree?
Cynthia: I'd love to live here...\xF000븁\x0000\nBut if I did, there would be a mountain\nof research materials piled up...\xF000븁\x0000\nAm I right? Cynthia, enough for now!\nNext time, clean up.
Cynthia: Here's my problem.\xF000븁\x0000\nI have a white swimsuit and\na black swimsuit...\xF000븀\x0000\nWhich one would look better on me?
Cynthia: Hmm. This is difficult.\xF000븁\x0000\nI was greedy and brought\na lot of swimsuits, but now I can't pick\xF000븀\x0000\nwhich one to wear.
Iris: Oh, hey!\nDid you see Cynthia's Garchomp?\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's too cute!
Iris: Soon, Drayden and I are going\nto ride the cruise ship!\xF000븁\x0000\nCastelia City is wall-to-wall people,\nbut if I'm with him, I'll be OK!
Iris: Sometimes I think about the village\nwhere I was born, but I'm totally OK!\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause I met lots of Pokémon--\nand all of you!
Iris: Look! Look! It's the ocean!
Iris: The ocean is so pretty. I love it!\nSo I stayed underwater a long time.\xF000븀\x0000\nI made everyone worry!
Skyla: I get along well with Elesa, but\nPokémon battles are a different story!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you're not super prepared,\nyour battles with Electric types\xF000븀\x0000\nwill leave you in shock!
Skyla: Seeing the ground again after\nsafely passing through a rain cloud\xF000븀\x0000\nin a violent rainstorm...\xF000븁\x0000\nSomeday, I'd like to share\nthat moment with you.
Skyla: I was just thinking about that.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen it comes to swimsuits...\xF000븁\x0000\nYou're either about self-composure\nor you're about self-exposure!
Skyla: Even distant Sinnoh is just a hop,\nskip, and a jump if I use my cargo plane.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut... I also love to travel the sky\nwith a Pokémon when it's using Fly!
Skyla: Mmm...\nSwimming in the ocean sure feels great!
Elesa: I must say it's difficult for people\nto draw out a Pokémon's charm\xF000븀\x0000\nif they don't have any themselves.
Elesa: You know Nimbasa City?\xF000븁\x0000\nYou know it runs on energy generated\nby Electric-type Pokémon?\xF000븁\x0000\n...Just kidding!
Elesa: Getting wrapped up in worries\nis bad for your body and spirit.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's when you must short out your\nlogic circuits and reboot your heart.
Elesa: Without a word...\nWithout even a whisper...\xF000븁\x0000\nMy Pokémon connect me to other Trainers,\ntransmitting the current of my feelings.
Elesa: Put bluntly, \nswimsuits are nothing but cloth, right?
Lenora: Aren't Fossils amazing?\xF000븁\x0000\nAlthough they are not alive and\ncannot speak, they tell us so much\xF000븀\x0000\nabout the era in which they lived.\xF000븁\x0000\nHee, hee.\nIt was Professor Juniper who said that.
Lenora: TMs can be used as many times\nas you wish, to be sure.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you teach Retaliate to many different\nPokémon, eventually you should find\xF000븀\x0000\nthe perfect Pokémon for it!
Lenora: When I was a little girl,\nmy dad, who was a miner, would\xF000븀\x0000\nalways bring back bones for me.\xF000븁\x0000\nMy young heart was captured by bones!\nBefore I knew it, I was a researcher.
Lenora: Recently, a girl named Bianca\ncame to ask me about Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nA Trainer's curiosity is insatiable\nat any stage.
Lenora: Cynthia is a famous archeologist.\xF000븁\x0000\nIn the course of our research, we have\nshared many academic conversations.
