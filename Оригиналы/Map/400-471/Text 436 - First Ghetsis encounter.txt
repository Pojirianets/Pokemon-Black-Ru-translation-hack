Professor Juniper: Ah, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\nThere you are!\xF000븁\x0000\nTraveling with your Pokémon is truly one\nof the joys of being a Trainer!\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease follow me.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'd like to show you the most important\nplace for a Trainer to know!\xF000븁\x0000
Please listen, everyone.\xF000븁\x0000\nWe have something important to talk\nto you about. Wait here for a moment.
Please excuse me...\nWe are still preparing.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you could continue to be patient...
Please excuse me...\nWe are still preparing.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you could continue to be patient...\xF000븁\x0000

Cheren: Wasn't that the professor\nwaiting in front of the Pokémon Center?\xF000븁\x0000\nI know about the Pokémon Center\nalready. Anyway, I want to battle soon!\xF000븁\x0000\nReal battles are the best way to become\nstronger, you know!
Sounds like something's going\non in the plaza!\xF000븁\x0000
Well, let's have a little look-see.\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, come here a sec.\xF000븁\x0000
My name is Ghetsis.\xF000븁\x0000\nI am here representing Team Plasma.\xF000븁\x0000\nToday, ladies and gentlemen, I would like\nto talk to you about Pokémon liberation.
Huh?
What?
Ghetsis: I'm sure most of you believe\nthat we humans and Pokémon are partners\xF000븀\x0000\nthat have come to live together because\xF000븀\x0000\nwe want and need each other.\xF000븁\x0000\nHowever...\nIs that really the truth?\xF000븁\x0000\nHave you ever considered that perhaps\nwe humans...\xF000븀\x0000\nonly assume that this is the truth?\xF000븁\x0000
Pokémon are subject to the selfish\ncommands of Trainers...\xF000븁\x0000\nThey get pushed around when they are\nour “partners" at work...\xF000븁\x0000\nCan anyone say with confidence that\nthere is no truth in what I'm saying?
Yikes!
No way.
I don't know...
Ghetsis: Now, ladies and gentlemen,\nPokémon are different from humans.\xF000븁\x0000\nThey are living beings that contain\nunknown potential.\xF000븁\x0000\nThey are living beings from whom we\nhumans have much to learn.\xF000븁\x0000\nTell me, what is our responsibility toward\nthese wonderful beings called Pokémon?
What could it be?
Liberation?
Ghetsis: That's right!\nWe must liberate the Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nThen, and only then, will humans\nand Pokémon truly be equals.\xF000븁\x0000\nEveryone, I end my words here today by\nimploring you to consider the relationship\xF000븀\x0000\nbetween people and Pokémon...\xF000븀\x0000\nand the correct way to proceed.\xF000븁\x0000\nWe sincerely appreciate your attention.\xF000븁\x0000
Older Man: About that speech...\nWhat do you think we should do?\xF000븁\x0000
Younger Man: Liberate Pokémon?\nThat's not even possible!\xF000븁\x0000
???: \xF000븉\x0001\x0001Your Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000\nJust now, it was saying...\xF000븉\x0001\x0000\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Slow down. You talk too fast.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd what's this about Pokémon...talking?\nThat's an odd thing to say.\xF000븁\x0000
???: \xF000븉\x0001\x0001Yes, they're talking.\xF000븁\x0000\nOh.\nThen, you two can't hear it, either...\xF000븀\x0000\nHow sad.\xF000븁\x0000\nMy name is N.\xF000븉\x0001\x0001\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: My name is Cheren,\nand this is \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xF000븁\x0000\nWe were asked to complete the Pokédex,\nand we just left on our journey.\xF000븁\x0000\nMy main goal is to become the\nChampion, though.\xF000븁\x0000
N: \xF000븉\x0001\x0001The Pokédex, eh?\xF000븁\x0000\nSo... You're going to confine many, many\nPokémon in Poké Balls for that, then.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm a Trainer, too,\nbut I can't help wondering...\xF000븁\x0000\nAre Pokémon really happy that way?\xF000븉\x0001\x0000\xF000븁\x0000
\xF000븉\x0001\x0001Well, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, is it?\nLet me hear your Pokémon's voice again!\xF000븉\x0001\x0000\xF000븁\x0000
N: \xF000븉\x0001\x0001As long as Pokémon are confined\nin Poké Balls...\xF000븁\x0000\nPokémon will never become\nperfect beings.\xF000븁\x0000\nI have to change the world for\nPokémon, because they're my friends.\xF000븉\x0001\x0000\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Huh... Strange guy.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut I'm not going to worry about it.\xF000븁\x0000\nTrainers and Pokémon help\neach other out!\xF000븁\x0000\nListen, I'm going on ahead.\xF000븁\x0000\nI want to battle the Gym Leader\nin the next town--Striaton City.\xF000븁\x0000\nAim to battle Gym Leader after\nGym Leader. The best way for a Trainer\xF000븀\x0000\nto become stronger is to challenge\xF000븀\x0000\nthe Gym Leaders in each area.\xF000븁\x0000
What's this?\xF000븁\x0000\nYou and your Pokémon\nsomehow resemble each other!
Let me give you the benefit of\nmy experience.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou listening? The number of Pokémon\nyou can take with you at one time is six!
Pokémon do everything in\ntheir power for people.\xF000븁\x0000\nPeople treat these Pokémon\nwith love and affection.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's what I think our\nmutual relationship is.
Beautiful scenery and relaxing sounds...\xF000븁\x0000\nOh, man. I sure do loooove this place.\nSure makes me feel happy.
Some wild Pokémon jump out of the\ntall grass and attack...\xF000븁\x0000\nBut you can make friends with those\nPokémon if you reach out to them!
Accumula Town\nThe Fast-Growing Town!
