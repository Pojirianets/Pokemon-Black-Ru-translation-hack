My mama says there's a scary monster\nwho comes out of the big hole at night,\xF000븀\x0000\nso we have to stay home and be good!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut that monster must be a Pokémon.\nRight? So I'm not scared at all!
Along the road ahead, there is a\ncoastline that fishing fans love.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm busy, so I won't fish at night, but\nthere may be big fish!
My grandma loves to tell old stories,\nand she makes me listen to her long\xF000븀\x0000\nstories all the time.\xF000븁\x0000\nSometimes I just want to go out on my\nown and paint the town red!
Ever since I took a post here, I don't\nreally have anything to do.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm so bored! I'm afraid all my policing\nmuscles will shrivel up because I don't\xF000븀\x0000\nuse them anymore.
My Pokémon always goes out\nto have fun without me.\xF000븁\x0000\nI wonder where it gets that attitude?
Gahoon! Gahoon!
My work keeps me very busy, and I only\ngo home once a week or so.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm sorry to leave my wife lonely, but\nthat's the life of a powerful executive.\xF000븁\x0000\nOh, this is a souvenir from a business\ntrip, but she does not seem to need it,\xF000븀\x0000\nso I will give it to you.\xF000븁\x0000
I leave on a business trip\nagain tomorrow.\xF000븁\x0000\nI think of myself as a role model\nfor businesspeople.
