Ho! Hoo!\nWelcome to White Forest!\xF000븁\x0000\nIn White Forest, people live\nin harmony with nature and with Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease listen to the voice of the forest.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's saying “Bienvenue!"\nHo! Hoo! Hoo!\xF000븁\x0000
I do research into the Pokémon\nthat live in this forest.\xF000븁\x0000\nIn theory, you should find \xF000ā\x0001\x0000\nliving in this forest.\xF000븁\x0000
Hoo!\nThat's \xF000ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000\nSo it lives in this forest, too!\xF000븁\x0000
What's more, you caught it today!\nHo hoo!\xF000븁\x0000\nThis means there are \xF000ā\x0001\x0000\nin White Forest.\xF000븁\x0000\nFor you, my skilled Pokémon catcher--\nthis small trifle. Hoo!\xF000븁\x0000
If you return here tomorrow, I'm sure\nthe forest will say “Bienvenue" again!
Thank you very much for today.\nSee you again tomorrow!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe forest is murmuring, “À très vite!"\xF000븁\x0000
I'm researching the Pokémon\nthat live in this forest. Hoo!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut there haven't been any Pokémon\nrecently, and the forest is forlorn.
If you see \xF000ā\x0001\x0000 in this forest,\nplease let me know.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat will be proof that Pokémon\nare living in this forest.
But--that \xF000ā\x0001\x0000 wasn't caught\ntoday, was it? Hoo!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat I want to know is whether\n\xF000ā\x0001\x0000 is still living in the forest.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe forest itself wants to know, too!
Did you notice the sky's beauty today?\nTomorrow will be fine, too!
Let's go Berry picking together!
I need Berries for tomorrow's dinner,\nso go pick some, OK?
Let's have a Triple Battle with the\nPokémon I have worked so hard to raise!
A Triple Battle is a new style of battle\nin which you use three Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease get three Pokémon together\nto use in battle!
Oh... I wanted to see\nthe Pokémon you've raised.
I'll work even harder raising my Pokémon!
I have always lived with these Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nHmm. How would you like to try a\nTriple Battle with me?
In order to have a Triple Battle,\nyou need to have at least three\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon able to battle.
Oh...\nI hope I'll get to see them another time!
There are so many things to consider,\nbut that is part of the fun of\xF000븀\x0000\nTriple Battles!
