
It feels so peaceful here. I love it!
When you're surrounded by trees,\nyou feel like your entire being\xF000븀\x0000\nhas become one with nature.
City life seems like it would be\nreally nerve racking...
Fresh air!\nA comfortable breeze.\xF000븀\x0000\nMmmm... This place has everything.
No surprises, no stress--\nthat is the secret of a good life!
Pokémon are the same! They prefer to\nlive in a natural setting, too.
Here, everyone is pleasant and kind\nto everyone else.\xF000븁\x0000\nI want to work with everyone\nfor the sake of this incredible forest!
The force of nature commands\nour respect.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe force of nature is what supports\nall life. Nature's bounty brings us\xF000븀\x0000\nso much goodness.\xF000븁\x0000\nNature's power surpasses imitation!
Leo: Hello there! Ah... Doesn't it feel\nterrific to enjoy the beauties of nature?\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm Leo. I come from the Black City\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 visited.\xF000븁\x0000\nNice to meet you!\xF000븁\x0000
Leo: Hello there!\xF000븁\x0000\nToday, I woke up to the pleasant rustling\nof leaves in the wind.\xF000븀\x0000\nThis place is so relaxing!\xF000븁\x0000
Recently, I've been feeling a certain...\nHm, I don't know...\xF000븀\x0000\n...Maybe I'm craving the city lights.
Guess what?\nCheck this out!\xF000븁\x0000\nA Pidgey was eating food\nin the grass right over there!
Silvia: Why, hello!\xF000븁\x0000\nIsn't this place sublime?\nThe air is so fresh. It's all so tranquil.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm Silvia. I'm from the Black City\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 visited.\xF000븀\x0000\nIt's a pleasure to meet you!\xF000븁\x0000
Silvia: Even if I take off my glasses,\nI'll know exactly where I am.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat tells me is the lush greenery\nall around.\xF000븁\x0000
You know, the time I spend here is lovely,\nbut something's missing...\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's how I feel.
If my triple-strength glasses don't lie,\nI met a little Wurmple-kins in a spot\xF000븀\x0000\njust ahead of here!\xF000븁\x0000\nThis is a special place... So serene!
Dave: 'Sup! Call me Dave!\xF000븁\x0000\nI used to mix it up a lot with\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 in Black City!\xF000븁\x0000\nNice meetin' ya!\xF000븁\x0000\nI feel like this place is bold enough to\ntake in a tough guy like me!\xF000븁\x0000
Dave: 'Sup!\nI've got it goin' on today!\xF000븁\x0000\nListen up! I'm gonna spread the word\nabout all the awesome things about\xF000븀\x0000\nnature! With a fierceness!\xF000븁\x0000
What can I say?\nWhite Forest is too dull.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt doesn't have enough hustle and bustle\nto keep a guy like me interested.
Aaaaaaaeeeeeeeek!\nIs that a Gastly over there?\xF000븁\x0000\nOh, whew. It's just your shadow.\nBut I have seen a Gastly recently.
Britney: I'm \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000's friend Britney.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm used to living on the edge\nin Black City!\xF000븁\x0000
Britney: We're up to our ears in nature\nhere. It sure winds you down.\xF000븁\x0000\nCouldn't be more different from\nthe freewheelin' life in Black City!\xF000븁\x0000
Hmm.\xF000븁\x0000\nNow that I've started to think about it,\nI miss being wild and free in Black City.
Are you searching for Hoppip?\nNo problem! I saw one!\xF000븀\x0000\nRun through the tall grass and catch it!
Robbie: I'm Robbie from Black City,\nwhere \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 passed through!\xF000븀\x0000\nNice to meet you!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou know what? I'd never imagined\na place like this really existed.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's nothing but green as far as\nthe eye can see! I'm shocked!\xF000븁\x0000
Robbie: I was in Black City because I'm\nfascinated by architecture, but being\xF000븀\x0000\nin a forest is pretty nice, too!\xF000븁\x0000
Ohhhhhhh, am I bored! So bored!\nI want to go back to Black City!
Oh! You'll never guess!\xF000븁\x0000\nElekid! I saw an Elekid\nrunning off that way!\xF000븁\x0000\nMaybe I should chase it!
Miki: Hello!\nMy name's Miki! Nice to meet you!\xF000븁\x0000\nI battled \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 in Black City!\nSuper tough!\xF000븁\x0000
Miki: Ahhh, mmm... This place is soothing.\nI read somewhere that the scent of\xF000븀\x0000\ntrees and grass makes you feel calm,\xF000븀\x0000\nin an aromatherapy kind of way.\xF000븀\x0000\nThis place seems to have the same effect!\xF000븁\x0000
Gosh. Maybe I've become too calm...\n'Cause I'm bored now!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut that's worth feeling, too,\nfrom time to time.
Wait, what?\nA Togepi just ran behind you right now!
Ryder: Take a deep breath!\nThe air here is so pure and wonderful!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm Ryder. I'm from the Black City, where\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 visited. Good to meet you.\xF000븁\x0000
Ryder: Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen the air is this fresh,\nit gives you extra power for training!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut it is a bit of a problem not to have\na sparring partner!\xF000븁\x0000
Hyah... Hyah? Hyah?\xF000븁\x0000\nI've been having trouble lately\ngetting into my training...\xF000븁\x0000\nMaybe Black City suits me better...\n
When I was practicing forehand strikes\nwith my Pokémon, a Machop was watching\xF000븀\x0000\nus in envy. Why don't you go look for it?
Karenna: I got here from Black City\nas fast as I could!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm impressed by how \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 fights,\nand I know I still have a long way to go!\xF000븁\x0000
Karenna: Keep going! Yeah!\nMy Pokémon and I are running!\xF000븁\x0000
Phew... I'm tired of running!\xF000븁\x0000\nTime for another battle!\nFor that, back to Black City!
Oh. Are you going to run with me?\xF000븁\x0000\nI just saw a wild Slakoth.\nIf we go running, maybe you'll meet it.
Doug: Hello, hello! I'm Doug!!\nI came from Black City.\xF000븀\x0000\nI'm an acquaintance of \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xF000븁\x0000\nNow, there's someone who has furious\nPokémon battles!\xF000븁\x0000
Doug: When I'm surrounded\nby nature, I work!\xF000븀\x0000\nIt's coming along pretty well!\xF000븁\x0000
So, I've had a lot of fresh air,\nand I think I'm well refreshed!\xF000븁\x0000\nI have a lot of other work to do,\nso I want to go to Black City.
Recently, I saw a Shinx in this area!\nYes, just being here refreshes me!
Vincent: Hey, how are you?\xF000븁\x0000\nIn Black City, I was \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000's\nsparring partner.\xF000븁\x0000\nNot too bad of a Trainer, I'd say,\nbut not as strong as I am.\xF000븁\x0000
Vincent: The vastness of nature\nspices up my life!\xF000븁\x0000\nYeah, I really have taken a liking to\nthis place.\xF000븁\x0000
Well, you know, I was born and raised in\nthe city, so maybe I should go home soon.
Recently a Magby was staring at me from\nover there!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt ran as soon as our gazes met.\nIf it likes me, it should let me know!
Marie: The oxygen is so rich!\nJust like \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 said!\xF000븁\x0000\nIn a place like this, I'm sure I can focus\nand write my paper!\xF000븁\x0000
Marie: Fresh air and a good paper...\nOnce I write it, I'll present it in\xF000븀\x0000\nBlack City!\xF000븁\x0000
I'm good and refreshed, so I\nwant to go back to Black City.
A few seconds ago, when I was doing some\ndeep-breathing exercises, I saw a\xF000븀\x0000\nMagnemite imitating me! It made me laugh.
Lena: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000...?\nSorry. You look like someone I know...\xF000븁\x0000\nA person I met in Black City and had a\nPokémon battle with...\xF000븁\x0000
Lena: The plants grow thick and green\nwith the blessing of the soil.\xF000븀\x0000\nI want to be thankful for this as I walk.\xF000븁\x0000
People are drawn to man-made things.\nI miss Black City...
It's so peaceful here. I love listening to\nthe Grass-type Pokémon breathing and\xF000븀\x0000\nthe bird Pokémon chirping...\xF000븁\x0000\nDid you notice? A Ralts just ran past\nright behind you.
Carlos: Oh! Hello!\nThere is so much to see here!\xF000븁\x0000\nI just came from Black City, where I met\na Trainer named \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000\xF000븀\x0000\nwho was very strong. It was fun!\xF000븁\x0000
Carlos: Oh! Hello!\xF000븁\x0000\nI've traveled in many places, but places\nthis close to nature are very rare!\xF000븁\x0000
But, hmmm... I think it's about time\nto head somewhere else.
Starly!\xF000븁\x0000\nStarly was just there!\nWhy don't you go look for it?
Molly: So this is White Forest!\nIt's very different from Black City!\xF000븁\x0000\nHey, do you know a Trainer named\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 who is really strong?\xF000븁\x0000
Molly: I've been traveling, and I've seen\na lot of places, but I have never seen\xF000븀\x0000\na place this pretty before!\xF000븁\x0000
This is a pretty place, but maybe\na little boring...
Oh, that's right! An Azurill was running\nhappily toward the grass!\xF000븁\x0000\nMaybe I should run with the Pokémon\nin the grass!
Frederic: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000?!\xF000븁\x0000\n...Oh! My mistake!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm very frustrated at losing our\nPokémon battle, so I want a rematch\xF000븀\x0000\nthe next time I see that Trainer.\xF000븁\x0000
Frederic: Oh... Have a look at this!\nMy Pokémon is so happy!\xF000븁\x0000\nPokémon love nature, but...\nI'm the complete opposite!\xF000븁\x0000
Well, my Pokémon is having fun, but\nI'm starving for some excitement.
Just a second ago, my Pokémon was\nplaying with a wild Budew.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt ran away when it saw me, but\nit really looked like it was having fun!
Lynette: How are you?\xF000븁\x0000\nI was in Black City, and I got to battle\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, who was really strong!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt was wonderful.\xF000븁\x0000
Lynette: This environment with\nnothing but nature is nice, too.\xF000븀\x0000\nIt's soothing.\xF000븁\x0000
But I'm a little tired of being out in\nthe countryside.\xF000븁\x0000\nI want to spend time in a place where\nthere is more stuff.
I saw an Oddish today!\xF000븁\x0000\nI haven't really seen one before,\nso I was fascinated!
Pierce: Until recently, I was in\nBlack City. I also battled with\xF000븀\x0000\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 there.\xF000븁\x0000\nI suspect \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 likes White\nForest more than you might suspect.\xF000븁\x0000
Pierce: Living simply among\nnature and enjoying your own life...\xF000븁\x0000\nI think that is not a bad way to live.\xF000븁\x0000
Hmmm...\xF000븁\x0000\nBut I might be getting tired of\nthe slow life...
Today, I saw a Mareep!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's something you could\nonly see in White Forest!
Gene: Nature is great! But I remember\nBlack City sometimes.\xF000븁\x0000\nMy battle with \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 is an\nimportant memory!\xF000븁\x0000
Gene: My hobby is meeting Pokémon\nin their natural habitat!\xF000븁\x0000
But recently, I've been thinking I want\nto test the strength of the Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nI've met.
I met an Aron today! It was really lucky!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhite Forest definitely fits me\nlike a glove!
Piper: The natural surroundings here are\nvery comfortable.\xF000븁\x0000\nUntil recently, I was in Black City, and\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000's battling style was\xF000븀\x0000\nfairly efficient.\xF000븁\x0000
Piper: Leisurely time passed together\nwith Pokémon...\xF000븀\x0000\nThings like that are important.\xF000븁\x0000
But recently, for some reason, leisurely\npassing time like this makes me feel\xF000븀\x0000\na little impatient.
I spent today with a Bellsprout!\nIt was a precious experience!
Miho: Pokémon in White Forest\nare so adorable!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, who I met in\nBlack City, was pretty cute too!\xF000븁\x0000
Miho: Pokémon and this expansive nature!\xF000븁\x0000\nEveryone is in their natural state,\nand I think it's wonderful!\xF000븁\x0000
But I might need a little more\nthan just nature.\xF000븀\x0000\nI have to find more things I want to do!
In nature, Seedot and people can\nbecome friends...\xF000븀\x0000\nThat sure is a wonderful thing, isn't it?
Shane: Everyone is very honest\nin White Forest.\xF000븁\x0000\nI wonder if \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, who I just met\nin Black City, will like White Forest more\xF000븀\x0000\nthan you might expect.\xF000븁\x0000
Shane: Here both Pokémon and\npeople can just be themselves.\xF000븁\x0000
But I'm worried about how this\nmore honest me will be seen.
I just saw a Rhyhorn over there!\nA Rhyhorn in its natural state... Wow!
Ralph: In White Forest, it's fun how\npeople and Pokémon can deal with\xF000븀\x0000\none another directly.\xF000븁\x0000\nBefore, in Black City, I battled\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, and we were able to show\xF000븀\x0000\neach other how we felt!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat was fun, too!\xF000븁\x0000
Ralph: I want Pokémon and people to be\nable to face each other directly and\xF000븀\x0000\nunderstand one another.\xF000븁\x0000
But I also think I want to promptly\nbe able to show people how I feel!
I met a Lotad over there today!\xF000븁\x0000\nWe communicated our feelings to each\nother, and I'm still awed by the memory.
Eliza: A lifestyle where you encounter\nnature is fulfilling.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut when I had a Pokémon battle with\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 in Black City, something\xF000븀\x0000\nabout that made me feel fulfilled, too.\xF000븁\x0000
Eliza: When you encounter nature,\nyour heart becomes that much richer.\xF000븁\x0000
But...\xF000븁\x0000\nJust looking at nature doesn't fulfill\nyour spirit.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's what I've been thinking recently.
I saw a Trapinch, and it made\nmy heart happy.
Collin: My success story begins here!\xF000븁\x0000\nIn Black City, I had a rival named\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, but I don't have one here!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm going to make a fortune!\xF000븁\x0000
Collin: I like how everyone here looks\nso happy!\xF000븁\x0000\nI want to make them even happier with\nmy business!\xF000븁\x0000
Business opportunities don't just come\nrolling at you so easily.\xF000븁\x0000\nAhh... I feel like Black City may be a\nbetter fit for me...
Successful people are always looking up!\xF000븁\x0000\nSo I was looking up while I was walking,\nand I accidentally walked into an Abra.\xF000븀\x0000\nSorry, Abra!
Ken: I feel that I've grown as a Trainer\nwho can look at Pokémon with a\xF000븀\x0000\nbroad mindset.\xF000븁\x0000\nI wonder how \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, who I met in\nBlack City, is doing these days.\xF000븁\x0000
Ken: Studying many different Pokémon and\ngaining a lot of far-reaching knowledge\xF000븀\x0000\nwidens your world.\xF000븁\x0000
But now I'm thinking I'd rather think\nabout just one thing very deeply.
When you have a broad mindset, you\nnotice things about nature and yourself\xF000븀\x0000\nand about yourself and Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nI thought that when I saw a Nidoran⑭\nover there recently.
Jacques: When you see how many different\nPokémon there are in the world, you\xF000븀\x0000\nunderstand there are lots of different\xF000븀\x0000\nanswers to problems, too.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen I met \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 in Black City, I\nfelt that Trainer’s way of thinking was\xF000븀\x0000\none of those answers.\xF000븁\x0000
Jacques: Several different answers\nexist for each problem.\xF000븁\x0000\nWatching different Pokémon makes me feel\nthat way.\xF000븁\x0000
But I want to study something\nwith a more clear, definite answer...
A variety of Pokémon,\na variety of answers.\xF000븀\x0000\nAll of them equally valid.\xF000븁\x0000\nI thought that when I saw a\nNidoran⑮ over there recently.
Rosa: Here, you can feel growth from\nday to day.\xF000븁\x0000\nBefore, in Black City, when I battled\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, I thought I hadn't grown\xF000븀\x0000\nat all.\xF000븁\x0000
Rosa: Watching the growth of nature lets\nyou feel some kind of growth every day.\xF000븁\x0000
Well, that may be true, but just watching\nnature gets boring sometimes.\xF000븁\x0000\nI don't have anything to do.
Every day of being alive means many small\nchanges that give the day meaning.\xF000븁\x0000\nI thought that when I saw\na Whismur recently.
Herman: I've settled in here now, but\nbefore, when I lived in Black City...\xF000븁\x0000\nPokémon battles with \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000\nsure were fun!\xF000븁\x0000
Herman: Living here, surrounded by\nnature, is very calming.\xF000븁\x0000
But it's not like me to stay\nin one place forever.
Oh yeah... I just saw a Porygon!\xF000븁\x0000\nSo strange to see one here... It must\nhave taken a liking to the forest.\xF000븁\x0000\nI want to live the slow life here, too!
Emi: Right now, I'm on a leisurely\njourney, but before that, I had a goal:\xF000븀\x0000\nto win against \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 in Black City.\xF000븁\x0000
Emi: It's fun to travel as you like, with\nno particular goal in mind.\xF000븁\x0000
But maybe it's better to have at least\nsome idea of where you're going?
In my travels through this forest, I met\na Happiny! I was so happy!
Grace: The beauty of the Pokémon battle\nI had with \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 in Black City\xF000븀\x0000\ncan stand up to the beauty of nature!\xF000븁\x0000
Grace: The beauty created by nature...\nIts grandness exceeds human imagination.\xF000븁\x0000
The beauty I want to see right now is the\nartistry of human hands.\xF000븀\x0000\nI can't satisfy that craving here.
The beauty of the Bagon I just saw was\nnatural and good...
White Forest\nPeople and Nature in Harmony
