Professor Juniper: This is a\nPokémon Center!\xF000븁\x0000\nDon't you feel better as soon as you\nstep through the door?\xF000븁\x0000\nOK, let's start your tour!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Ooh, wait for me!\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: A Pokémon Center is a\ntruly incredible place!\xF000븁\x0000\nDo you know why?\nBecause your Pokémon can be healed!\xF000븀\x0000\nAnd, what's more, it's absolutely free!\xF000븁\x0000\nA Pokémon Center is a Trainer's\nbest friend!\xF000븁\x0000\nHere, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, give it a try.
Professor Juniper: Hey, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000.\nWhere are you off to?\xF000븁\x0000\nHumor me and talk to the lady at the\ncounter. Let her take your Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: You should be talking\nto the lady at the counter, not to me...
Bianca: All you need to do is give her\nyour Pokémon, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000.
Professor Juniper: OK. Now that your\nPokémon have rested, I'll show you how\xF000븀\x0000\nto use the PC at a Pokémon Center.\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: This is the PC.\nIt's free for any Trainer to use.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou can store Pokémon in your PC Boxes\nor select Pokémon stored in your\xF000븀\x0000\nPC Boxes to take along with you.\xF000븁\x0000\nIn addition, if you catch a new Pokémon\nwhile you have six Pokémon traveling\xF000븀\x0000\nwith you, the Pokémon you just caught is\xF000븀\x0000\nsent automatically to the PC network!\xF000븁\x0000\nSurprising, isn't it? Amazing, even.\nHere's something else that's cool.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you select my PC, I'll evaluate the\nprogress you've made on your Pokédex!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Professor...\xF000븁\x0000\nIt says “Someone's PC"\non the screen. Who is Someone?\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: Very good, Bianca.\nThat's a great observation!\xF000븁\x0000\nGood question, and I'd like to say more,\nbut for now, just ignore that and\xF000븀\x0000\ngo ahead and use the PC.\xF000븁\x0000\n“Someone" is the person who made the\nPokémon Storage System.\xF000븁\x0000\n...Someone I'm sure you'll meet someday!\nOK, let's move on!\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: Now, this is the\nPoké Mart.\xF000븁\x0000\nThis is the place to buy useful items and\nsell the ones you don't need anymore!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat gentleman over there will\nhelp you with a smile!\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: So, let's\nwrap this up.\xF000븁\x0000\nI've given you the basics of being\na Trainer!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm going to head back to Nuvema Town.\xF000븁\x0000\nOne final thing...\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen you get to Striaton City, go and\nmeet an inventor named Fennel.\xF000븁\x0000\nShe's a friend of mine from long ago, and\nI'm sure she'll help you on your way!\xF000븁\x0000\nBest of luck! I hope that your journeys\nprove to be the adventure of a lifetime!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Ooh! What should I buy?\xF000븁\x0000\nPotions and Poké Balls are definitely\nimportant. Ummm...thinking...\xF000븁\x0000
Be sure to save what's happened up\nto this point before you forget.\xF000븀\x0000\nThen you can take a break.
