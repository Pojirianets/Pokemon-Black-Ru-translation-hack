I decided to find a new Pokémon partner\naround Route 13.
Marvelous Bridge is really mind boggling!\nSo I am taking a rest!
Did you know? Before Marvelous Bridge\nwas built, there was a girl who always\xF000븀\x0000\nplayed with Abra around here.\xF000븁\x0000\nShe was so full of energy...
What do people buy from the\nvending machine?\xF000븁\x0000\nTo keep checking on that...\nThis is my life.
Hey, you!\nDon't you want to try a Triple Battle?
Triple Battles are battles with\nthree Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease get three Pokémon ready\nfor battle!
You are a Trainer, yet you are not\nprepared to battle?
They say chance favors\nthe prepared mind.
I want to research an effective\nfighting method for Rotation Battles.\xF000븁\x0000\nWould you have a battle with me?
A Rotation Battle is a new kind of battle\nthat uses three Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease prepare at least three Pokémon\nfor battle!
If you're a Trainer, you should be\nmore aggressive.
Now you can have Rotation Battles with\nyour friends!
