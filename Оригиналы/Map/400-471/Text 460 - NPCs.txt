Oh ho! With a face like that,\nI'll bet you're a Pokémon Trainer!\xF000븁\x0000\nI work as a Depot Agent on the\nBattle Subway!\xF000븁\x0000\nHave you tried challenging the\nBattle Subway yet?\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's a hot spot for those who want\nsome serious battling action!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut some people get too wrapped up\nin their battles, and there's no end\xF000븀\x0000\nto the lost-and-found items.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's right. Nobody ever came to\npick this up, so I'll give it to you!\xF000븁\x0000
I have a lost-and-found item\nthat no one has claimed.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you don't mind, could you take it\noff my hands?\xF000븁\x0000
Oh! I've been waiting for you!\xF000븁\x0000\nRecently, we've gotten more passengers,\nso there's more lost-and-found items!\xF000븁\x0000\nNo one has claimed this, so if you don't\nmind, could you take it off my hands?\xF000븁\x0000
No worries. No worries.\nJust take it!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's better for a Trainer to use it than\nfor me to hold on to it.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm sure the item is happier, too!
If I have another lost-and-found\nitem, come get it, OK?\xF000븁\x0000\nAlso, if you're interested, take on the\nBattle Subway in Nimbasa City!
Oh, my. There's no more room for\nthe \xF000ĉ\x0001\x0000.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou'll need to remove some from your Bag\nbefore you can accept any more!
