Cheren: Professor Juniper?\nWe know your name.\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: Come, come, Cheren!\nThis is not a time to take things lightly.\xF000븁\x0000\nToday is a day to remember always, so\nit's best to behave with some formality.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat being so, once again, my name is\nProfessor Juniper, and I am researching\xF000븀\x0000\nwhen and how the creatures called\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon came into existence.\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, that's unusual!\nYou've already had a Pokémon battle!\xF000븁\x0000\nSo maybe that's why...\xF000븁\x0000\nIt feels as though your Pokémon have\nalready begun to trust you!\xF000븁\x0000\nBy the way, would you like to give your\nPokémon a nickname?
Professor Juniper: Uh-huh, I see.\nAre you OK with the nickname \xF000Ă\x0001\x0000?
Professor Juniper: \xF000Ă\x0001\x0000 is its\nname. That is such a great name!\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: You aren't planning\nto use a nickname? Well, that's fine, too.\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: As for why I gave all\nof you Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: It's for the Pokédex, right?\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Pokédex?\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: I am astonished.\nNice work, Cheren!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou have already studied Pokémon\nextensively, haven't you?\xF000븁\x0000\nStill, let me explain everything from the\nbeginning, for everyone's sake.\xF000븁\x0000
The Pokédex is a high-tech device that\nautomatically records the Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nyou encounter!\xF000븁\x0000\nSo, I want you three to visit many\nplaces and meet all of the Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nin the Unova region!\xF000븁\x0000
This is my request.\xF000븁\x0000\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\nCheren! Bianca!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou'll go on an adventure to\ncomplete the Pokédex, will you not?
Professor Juniper: Here is what I need\nfrom you!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat I want to hear are the courageous\nwords of people who will blaze new\xF000븀\x0000\npaths around the world!\xF000븁\x0000\nI want you three to travel to many\ndistant places and meet all of the\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon in the Unova region!
Bianca: OK!\xF000븁\x0000\nI mean... Yes, professor!\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Thank you very much.\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause of you, I can become a Pokémon\nTrainer, exactly as I've always wished.\xF000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: All of you, thanks!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou have given me the best\npossible answer!\xF000븁\x0000
\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000 obtained the \xF000\xFF00\x0001\x0002Pokédex\xF000\xFF00\x0001\x0000!
Professor Juniper: Next, I need to teach\nyou how to meet Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease meet me at Route 1, OK?\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: S-since the professor asked us,\nit's OK to go on an adventure, right?\xF000븁\x0000\nI can explore and maybe find out what\nI want to do in life. I think I'd like that.\xF000븁\x0000
Cheren: Of course.\xF000븁\x0000\nWe can travel however we want\nwhile we complete the Pokédex.
Bianca: For some reason,\nmy heart is pounding, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat are you and \xF000ā\x0001\x0001 going to do?
Cheren: Finally, I can become\na Pokémon Trainer.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll have real battles with other\nTrainers and get stronger. Wait and see!
Professor Juniper: Why, hello,\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000! How have you been lately?\xF000븁\x0000
Cedric: Hey, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\nAre you meeting lots of Pokémon?\xF000븁\x0000\nThere really are lots of Pokémon\nin the Unova region and the\xF000븀\x0000\nrest of the world!



Cedric: Hey, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000
Skreet! Skreet!
Bianca: Professor Juniper is\nletting me help out.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen I was looking at my Pokédex,\nI realized something...\xF000븁\x0000\nI met so many Pokémon during my journey.\xF000븁\x0000\nI just want to learn more and more\nand more about the little darlings!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh yeah! That's right.\xF000븁\x0000\n\xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, do you know\nabout massive outbreaks of Pokémon?
Bianca: I knew you'd know, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm sure you also know that lots of a\ncertain Pokémon appear in the grass all\xF000븀\x0000\nover, and that if you look at the electric\xF000븀\x0000\nsigns in the Route gates, you can see\xF000븀\x0000\nwhere the mass outbreaks are happening\xF000븀\x0000\nin the Unova region!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Tee-hee!\nOK, then, I'll tell you about it.\xF000븁\x0000\nFirst of all, lots of a certain Pokémon\nappear in the grass all over.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you look at the electric signs in the\nRoute gates, you can see where the\xF000븀\x0000\nmass outbreaks are happening in the\xF000븀\x0000\nUnova region! Isn't that amazing!\xF000븁\x0000
I have to study lots of Pokémon\nresearch, but I don't mind. This is\xF000븀\x0000\nthe answer I found during my adventure!\xF000븀\x0000\nIt's actually a lot of fun!\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd I have an idea! Every now and then,\ncome have a Pokémon battle with me, OK?\xF000븁\x0000\n'Cause by doing that, I'll learn\na lot more about Pokémon!
Bianca: \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000, did you know this?\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you give a Pokémon called Feebas\na Prism Scale and trade it with someone,\xF000븀\x0000\napparently it evolves.\xF000븁\x0000\nIsn't that amazing?\xF000븁\x0000\nPokémon sure are mysterious beings,\naren't they?
