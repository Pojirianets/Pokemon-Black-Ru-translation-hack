If you wreck Great Landorus's little\nshrine, it'll cause a bad bad storm!\xF000븁\x0000
That's not true!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe Pokémon that brings bad\nthunderstorms is a different Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
That's not true!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe Pokémon that brings bad windstorms\nis a different Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
No, silly, you've got it wrong!\xF000븁\x0000
This is a shrine for Great Landorus. It\npunished a Pokémon that did a bad thing!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you wreck the shrine, it can't punish\nthat stormy Pokémon if it comes back!\xF000븁\x0000
But that doesn't make any sense!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf a Pokémon does a bad thing,\nGreat Landorus will come to help us,\xF000븀\x0000\nwhether it has a shrine or not!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou're the silly one!\xF000븁\x0000
No, YOU'RE silly! Hey, wait!\xF000븁\x0000
This little shrine is dedicated to a\nPokémon called Landorus.\xF000븁\x0000\nThey say that when Tornadus and\nThundurus were whipping up storms that\xF000븀\x0000\ndamaged houses and fields all over the\xF000븀\x0000\nUnova region, Landorus made them stop.\xF000븁\x0000
That's a story from way long ago, when\nmy grandpa was a little boy.\xF000븁\x0000
So if Tornadus and Thundurus come here\nagain, Great Landorus may come back.\xF000븁\x0000
That's what my grandpa told me!
It's a small, weathered shrine.
It's a small, weathered shrine.\xF000븁\x0000
Tornadus and Thundurus are struggling\ninside their Poké Balls!\xF000븁\x0000
Karamukukuk!
Landorus flew far away into the sky...
