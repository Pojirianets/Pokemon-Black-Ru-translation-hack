Rood: It smells of the sea here.\xF000븁\x0000\nThis place has the same ocean smell\nas where I was born...\xF000븁\x0000
Ghetsis wandered the lands of this world\nall over, collecting knowledge of all kinds\xF000븀\x0000\nwhile searching for like-minded people.\xF000븁\x0000\nFrom the moment we met, he\nunderstood what I desired.\xF000븁\x0000
The ability to understand the minds and\nthe needs of others...\xF000븁\x0000\nThis is an ability that everyone needs\nto survive.\xF000븁\x0000\nMy lord N is a kind and excellent person\nwho understands the hearts of Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut, conversely, perhaps his ability to\nunderstand the hearts and feelings\xF000븀\x0000\nof people is not developed enough.\xF000븁\x0000
But... Even that was part of the\nperfection of Ghetsis's plan.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen it comes to Ghetsis, I cannot\nseparate the truths from the lies.\xF000븁\x0000\nSee this? I received it from Ghetsis,\nbut I no longer need it.\xF000븀\x0000\nI hope you can put it to good use.\xF000븁\x0000
Rood: Someday, if my lord N develops the\nability to understand the feelings\xF000븀\x0000\nof people as well as Pokémon,\xF000븀\x0000\nI would like us to gather again.\xF000븁\x0000\nMore than anything, I want to see\nN confront Ghetsis.\xF000븁\x0000
Looker: Ah... And now,\nabout Team Plasma...\xF000븁\x0000\nI am an officer of the\nInternational Police, and there are so\xF000븀\x0000\nmany things you must tell me at once!\xF000븁\x0000
Rood: If that is what you desire...\xF000븁\x0000
Looker: Many thanks!\xF000븁\x0000\nNow, Ghetsis notwithstanding,\nthere yet remains but \xF000Ȁ\x0001\x0000 of the\xF000븀\x0000\nSeven Sages still at large.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat it is they are thinking,\nwhat it may be they are hoping,\xF000븀\x0000\nthis is the information I have need of.\xF000븀\x0000\nQuick and soon, say I!\xF000븁\x0000
Looker: Thank you a lot!\xF000븁\x0000\nEh, \xF000Ā\x0001\x0000...\nOn a topic I must speak to you.\xF000븁\x0000\nHaving received such a report, of\nsomeone far from here, who has seen\xF000븀\x0000\na person like N and...a dragon Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nI am on my way to verify the veracity\nof this information.\xF000븀\x0000\nWe will meet again one day!\xF000븁\x0000
