No, no, a thousand times no!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: But, I'm...\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm a good Trainer who got\na Pokémon and everything!\xF000븀\x0000\nI can totally go on an adventure!\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca: Oh...\nIt's OK.\xF000븁\x0000\n...It's fine!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll be waiting for you in front\nof the lab, OK?\xF000븁\x0000
Bianca's Dad: What nonsense is this?\xF000븁\x0000\nHow could my daughter, who knows\nnothing about the world,\xF000븀\x0000\nbe going on a journey with Pokémon?
Bianca's Mom: Don't mind my husband,\ndear. He's just being overprotective.\xF000븁\x0000\nAll children go on adventures\nwith Pokémon.\xF000븀\x0000\nIt's part of growing up.
Bianca's Dad: Well, then.\nI look forward to the stories Bianca will\xF000븀\x0000\nhave for us next time she comes home.
Bianca's Dad: Even if there are many\nthings you want to do,\xF000븀\x0000\nyou're only one person.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's frustrating, isn't it?
Bianca's Mom: Choosing one thing means\nhaving to give up something else.\xF000븁\x0000\nSo, of course it's very hard to decide.
Bianca: I was just looking over\nmy Pokédex again and thinking...\xF000븁\x0000\nI sure have met a lot\nof different Pokémon.
