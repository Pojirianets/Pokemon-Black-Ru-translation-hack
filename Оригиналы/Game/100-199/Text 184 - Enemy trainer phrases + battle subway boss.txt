Have we met or not? I don't remember.\nWell, nice to meet you!
Yahoo! Ya-hoooooo!\nI won again!
No way! Nooo way...\nI lost again...
All right!\nI will show you my power!
Amazed? Surprised?\nBy the power of my Pokémon?!
You are incredible!\nI am astonished and surprised!
May... May I help you?!
Oh! Oh!\nYes, we can?!
Un-un-unbelievable!
Don't let your guard down,\nor you may cry when a kid beats you...
I may be young, but I don't think\nI will lose, even against grown-ups.
Fweh! I am just a kid!\nYou are fighting for keeps!
Let's have an awesome\nPokémon battle!
Mmmph! Mmmmmph!\nYou see, it's fun to win!
You are pretty amazing!\nAnd you have totally exhausted me...
Very serious from the very beginning.\nAre you ever really prepared for this?
Seriously, winning a serious battle is\nseriously great!
Seriously, I lost. I am seriously depressed.\nBut you are seriously cool.
Go easy on me!\nThis is my first battle...
I can't believe I won my first battle!\nSay, did you go easy on me?
Ouch! That hurts!!\nBut... You are great...
You... You know,\nthese Pokémon are my friends.
I... I... I am sorry...\nI just wanted to introduce them to you.
Just being with these Pokémon\nmakes me happy...
...Heehee. I'm confident in calculation\nand analysis.
Heheh. Exactly as I planned...\nI don't feel like losing.
Ohhhh... Calculation and analysis\nare no match for coincidence...
We're about to have a Pokémon battle.\nAt the very least, we say hello!
That could have gone better,\nbut thank you very much.
I feel like crying in frustration,\nbut thank you very much.
I am studying every single day...\nSo I am taking a break for a change.
You see, playing with Pokémon is fun.\nI want to study Pokémon.
Ah, my Pokémon lost...\nI may be better at studying.
I want to be a Pokémon research\nscientist when I grow up.
I'm wondering if Pokémon research\nprojects require test subjects...
I must do my best to learn\nmore about Pokémon.
Ah... You look strong...\nI hope I will be all right...
Oops, you were not as strong\nas I expected... Looks can be deceiving.
I could tell you are a strong Trainer!\nWhat you see is what you get.
I always get the best grades!\nI will try to be No. 1 for everything!
I will keep winning, winning, winning...\nI will be No. 1!
If I lose at such an early stage,\nI cannot be No. 1.
Wha--? You wanna fight with me?\nI suppoooose...
Ah, I shoulda known.\nDon't blame me.
Oh, wow. I am no match for you.\nYour Pokémon are great.
Mrrrrr... Mmrr grrr...\nGrrrrr... Mrrrrr...
Grrrrr... Mmrrrr...\n...Oh? Did I win?
Grrrrmmm... Mrrr...\nOh? Is that it?
Here I am, a master of the universe and\nthe mover and shaker of the future!
The class differences always tell.\nI am worried about your future prospects.
I got carried away.\nI am worried about my future prospects.
Are you my opponent?\nYou look kind of hungry.
Have you eaten well?\nYou cannot do well on an empty stomach.
Are you really an ordinary person?\nWhat do you eat?
I am a nouveau riche celebrity,\nso I am stingy with my money!
Unfortunately, you lost.\nNow, give me your lunch money!
I lost, but I won't give you\nmy lunch money!
My mom chose my Pokémon.\nI don't think I will lose.
You see! I am fine as long as\nI listen to my mom.
Mommy! Mommy! Where are you?\nPlease come and hug me!
A Trainer who looks gorgeous!\nI hope your battle is just as beautiful.
Such a looker lost against me?!\nI am a little disappointed.
Oh my, the battle was also gorgeous.\nI find myself drawn to you.
What kind of Pokémon do you like?\nHey, hey. Let me see!
Your taste in Pokémon is excellent, \nbut you are a disappointment as a Trainer.
Your taste in Pokémon is truly awful,\nbut you are a first-class Trainer!
I am sorry--I lied.\nI am not a rich girl.
Everybody paid more attention to me\nwhen I pretended to be rich.
The truth is I am just the daughter\nof a Clerk ⑭.
Ahaha...
Ahahaha...
Argh...
Preschooler gonna battle you!\nNice to meet you.
Little baby is a winna!\nTank you! Tank you!
Da Preschooler lost!\nTank you anyways!
I am a genius Preschooler!\nI am already prepping for college.
You lost against a Preschooler...\nHow old are you again?
I am confident in studying, but\nI am just a beginner in Pokémon battles.
I am a hero!\nI refuse to lose!
I AM a hero!\nI beat the bad person!
A hero never loses.\nA hero never dies.
I am very strong.\nI will never lose.
Daddy gave me these Pokémon!\nThey've got to be strong!
AAAAAAAAAH!
I thinks it are strange\nit complaining when they lose.
When I win, I are glad!\nHip, hip, hurray!
Boo!! I did lost... I are frustrated,\nbut I guess things my own fault.
Are you going to bully me?
You didn't bully me. I like you!
You bullied me, but I like you\n'cause you are strong!
Gmmmmm! Pokémon!\nGive it all you've got!
Mmmmph! Yahoo! Yahoo!\nThank you very much, Pokémon!
Boooooo! Come on, Pokémon.\nTry harder!
I am four years old! I will do my best!\nTrainer, do your best, too!
I am four years old! I did my best!\nTrainer, you are weak.
I am four years old! I did my best!\nTrainer, you did your best, too!
Lalalala... Lalalala...\nI am a loner...
Lalalala... Lalalala...\nDrifting like clouds...
Lalalala... Lalalala...\nUntil I see you again...
I am not an ordinary Backpacker,\n'cause I am a newlywed.
'Cause my wife and I have no money,\nwe're hitchhiking on our honeymoon.
This trip is our honeymoon!\nBut I wandered off from my wife...
I am in the middle of my penniless travel.\nIt has its own charm.
Travel is best when you are poor\nand when you are young.
Aww... I am hungry...\nPlease spare something...
Argh! My backpack is heavy!\nWhy is it so heavy?
Why is this backpack so heavy?\nDid you put something in it?
Arrrgh! Why didn't you wait\nuntil I put down my bag?!
I wanted a short trip to heal my broken\nheart, but it's been a few months now...
A trip cannot heal my heartbreak...
I have no home to return to,\nso maybe I will live as a drifter...
Hm. I wonder who you are.\nI wonder if you'll have a battle with me.
You... You are weak.\nOr am I just strong?
You are strong.\nI wanna run away.
Sometimes I need a little time to rest.\nI will relax here!
That was a nice, refreshing time.\nI will work hard tomorrow!
That was supposed to be refreshing.\nNow I am more stressed out.
I hope to work hard, save money,\nand have a quiet life.
Everybody has a different dream.\nI just want to have a normal life.
I want to have security and happiness\nrather than chasing a big dream.
Hey! Welcome! \nWe have very fresh ingredients!
What do you think of my Pokémon?\nThey are fresh!
Thank you very much!\nHow were mine?
Didn't you come here for\na Pokémon battle?
Don't be scared, or\nyou will never win.
You are a strong Trainer.\nPlease forgive me.
Hiya, honey! Welcome!\nHave you decided what you'll have?
Order up! One humiliation\nin a Pokémon battle, over easy.
Order up! One glorious victory\nin a Pokémon battle, sunny side up.
Meow, meow, it's a battle, meow.\n(That sounds stupid, doesn't it?)
Yeah! Meow! I won, meow!\n(I seriously want to quit this job.)
Meowww... I lost, meowww.\n(Seriously, I am sooo embarrassed.)
My love for Pokémon is stronger than\nanybody else's. Love can do anything.
This victory proves\nmy true love for Pokémon.
Love should conquer all. Love should\nhelp me win, shouldn't it?
Oh, do you want to see the Pokémon\nthat I am proudest of?
What do you think about my \ndear Pokémon? Aren't they great?
Oh, my goodness!\nMy poor Pokémon...
For the honor of the branch office!\nHere I go!
I am the branch manager of the Pokéfan.\nI won!
Pfft. Good-bye for now, child!\nI'll remember this!
I lost a lot of things because\nI love Pokémon too much...
I've devoted my life to Pokémon. \nI see things differently than you do.
I cannot win even with my devotion.\nWhat shall I do?!
Listen. I love love love Pokémon.
I will be a Pokémon in my next life.
I love your Pokémon, too!\nPlease let me pet them!
I am not good at battling, but\nthis is one of the duties of a Pokéfan.
I kept the honor of the Pokéfan.\nHahaha.
Cheers, all you Pokéfans!!\nMay the Pokéfan last forever!
I wanted to go hiking,\nbut I took the wrong train.
Well, this place is also interesting.
Ah, mountains... The mountains are\ncalling me.
I am no mere Hiker.\nCall me an alpinist.
A mountain maniac like me\nis properly called an alpinist.
A specialist in mountainous matters.\nThat is an alpinist.
I'm a Fisherman, so I have my rod here,\nbut this is cumbersome.
I won the battle, but\nI did not need this rod at all.
Ah... This rod is so cumbersome!\nI will quit fishing!
Oh, I kin tell yer rilly sumpthin'.
I knew it. You rilly ARE sumpthin'.
Like always, the big one done got away.
I won't be a Parasol Lady without\na parasol, so I must use it.
I think it is strange to use\na parasol indoors, though.
My parasol... My parasol is broken!\nI will be just a Lady.
My boyfriend left me on a rainy day.\nSo I will take it out on you.
The rain is piercing my broken heart\nand washing it clean.
They say rainy days never stay,\nbut will the rain in my heart ever stop?
I've been waiting for someone like you\nfor a long, long time.
I know you are the best.\nI will never let you go.
I like you.\nPlease be my friend.
I won't go easy on you just because\nyou're a kid. Bring it on!
Heh. You cannot have a battle\nif you are afraid of losing.
Humph. I am still weak.\nI feel sorry for my Pokémon...
I am bad and stupid, but\nI am very serious about Pokémon.
I feel peaceful only when I am with Pokémon.
I hope you will find something\nyou can be serious about.
My shiny bald head is my secret.
The more I shave my head,\nthe stronger I can be.
You should have\na shiny bald head to be stronger.
You must be laughing at me 'cause\nI rode this far on my motorbike.
I've decided to live my life on my bike.
I am a coward who cannot even go out\nwithout my bike.
I am roaring around on my bike\nand chasing my own dream.
I feel I am getting one step closer\nto my dream.
You have to follow your own dream!
I am a Biker.\nBut I've never ridden a bike.
I am a Biker.\nI don't have any friends yet.
I am a Biker.\nI've never won yet.
My Pokémon are on the rise! I raised\nthem with special yeast bread!
You'll get well again if you\neat my special bread.
You are strong.\nAre you eating my special bread?
One loaf, two loaves... No matter how\nmany times I count, one loaf is missing.
One loaf of bread is missing...\nThe master will be angry...
Oh, I'm so resentful...\nWhere is the missing loaf of bread?
Hey, you!\nDo you eat a good breakfast every day?
I never miss breakfast,\nso I am healthy and plump!
The first step for healthy living is\nto eat a good breakfast.
I am not loafing on the job!\nI am on patrol!
This place is dangerous!\nThis is too much fun!
I know about trouble like you!\nI am keeping my eye on you!
I am a Policeman!\nIn other words, I am justice!
Justice always prevails!\nThat is why I won!
I... I am a Policeman!\nWhy did justice fail?
I got scolded by my boss, and I lost\nmy motivation. I'll take it out on you!
Hehehe. You see!\nI am brilliant here.
Oh, man! \nAm I useless here, too?
I am young and fresh!\nI am nothing if not young!
What do you think? What do you think?\nI am very strong, aren't I?
I am fine even when I lose a battle.\nI am lively, lively!
I worked my way up to the top of the\ncomedians, and now I am a big shot.
You have a good sense of humor.\nDo you want to be my assistant?
Looking at you reminds me of friends\nfrom when I was working my way up.
I cannot do impressive stunts,\nso I will perform normally.
I am sorry. I shouldn't have won.\nI am just a Harlequin.
I am a Harlequin, but I'm sorry I cannot\nplay the fool after I lose.
I am smiling, though I am sad at heart.\nThis is the play of a lifetime!
You! That's not in the script!\nYou ruined the play!
Ha ha ha! It is the destiny of a Harlequin\nto smile when he loses.
Oh, no! I came to play\nwithout taking off my uniform.
Wow! Seriously? I won!\nI cannot go home when I win.
Ahhhhh! And I lost!\nThis is not my day.
You know, I am very popular,\nthanks to this costume.
Being popular is simple...\nI like it that way.
I feel good 'cause I am popular, but\nsometimes I feel empty.
Welcome back.\nYou must be tired from your work.
You must be tired.\nPlease do rest awhile.
That was superb!\nYou are very strong indeed.
I used to be so popular, but\nnow I am all washed up.
I was overwhelmed by success, I took it\nfor granted, and I did not work hard.
As times change, values change.\nI realized it too late.
Well, well, you strike impressive poses.\nIf you lose, I hope you'll model for me.
I will do a sketch of you,\nfrustrated by failure. Please hold still.
Please wait. I can create a masterpiece\nif you are my model.
Sensitivity is important for battles, too.\nYou! Feel it!
You need to feel it more! More!\nOtherwise you cannot win!
Ahh! I sense it!\nI sense your hypersensitive sensitivity!
Everybody grows bit by bit\nif somebody cherishes them.
I have cherished these Pokémon\nsince they were small.
You are also here \nbecause someone cherished you.
These days, when children fight,\ntheir parents fight on their behalf.
Children of childish parents.\nWhat kind of adults will they become?
Childish fights among adults are\nworse than fights among kids.
Iaaaa! You are cute!\nI want to take you home as my own!
Your face is cute even when you've lost!\nI want to comfort you, little one!
Ooooh! You are really cute!\nI want to raise you as my own!
I'll show you we can break you.\nWe've trained in the field!
How were my Pokémon?\nThey're very powerful, aren't they?
That's strange! I wonder why...\nI shouldn't be outmuscled.
Oh, you look very active!\nWhat say we battle?
OK! It's done!\nHow are my partners?
Goood, you are young!\nMy partners were totally crushed!
Pokémon battles after work\nare the one thing I truly enjoy.
Ahhhhhhhhh!\nThat's why I cannot quit training Pokémon.
Urrrrrrrgh. It hurts.\nIt hurts for a single man like me.
Pokémon are popular at work, too.\nOld guys can enjoy these battles!
Am I good for a guy who just\nbattles during his lunch breaks?
Old guys and kids can both enjoy\nbattling with Pokémon.
Keep pedaling even when your legs\ncrumble. This is the secret of Cyclists.
A Pokémon trained by cycling\ncould never lose against a person like you.
My cycling has no limits.\nI will challenge you again someday.
My steel-wheeled friend brought me here.\nIsn't it the greatest ever?
This is my best friend forever!\nAlways reliable and true as steel!
I blundered, stumbled, and lost...\nWell, I still have my one and only.
Fun time is over.\nTime to wake up!
The end always comes as a shock.
You are greatly mistaken if you\nthink you can dream forever.
I'm done! It's just not good enough.\nA Bicycle is not enough of a challenge.
A Bicycle cannot satisfy me.\nI will join the Bikers!
Faster!! I want a speed that nobody\ncan beat!
I won't surrender to you.\nYou are nothing but a young fellow!
I won't lose against whippersnappers!\nI shall struggle on until the day I die!
Impressive! You are skillful for a\ngreen stripling, young fellow!
Like a powerful foaming cleanser,\nI will remove you!
Like a well-polished tile,\nthis is a sparkling victory!
Like a worn-out dust rag...
I am doing this job because\nI love love love trains.
You are happy if you choose something\nyou like as a job.
I love trains too much.\nIt's a sickness, really...
Your journey will end here.\nI am your terminal.
I praise you for coming up here.\nBut now, go home!
Ah... I didn't see it coming.\nI will rest over here...
I need to prove I'm worthy.\nI cannot lose against a child.
Am I childish? Adults do\nwhatever it takes to win.
My honor, my pride... I cannot show myself\nto my coworkers in such a miserable state.
Hey, I've learned a few things in my time.\nLet me demonstrate!
Not everyone likes me, but\nI am quite the Trainer, aren't I?
Your technique shows wisdom...\nAre you also an old man?
They say a company with lively workers\nis a good company!
I work hard all the time!\nI can battle 24/7!
Oh, look at the time!\nI have to get back to work!
My boss is seriously annoying!\nI believe I'll take it out on you!
Thank you for having a battle with me.\nI feel much better.
You should choose your company carefully,\nbecause you cannot choose your boss.
Are you my next patient?\nGet over here!
Good, good. I am glad\nthat you and your Pokémon are obedient.
Wait! You, wait!\nThe surgery has not started yet!
When there is a patient, I will be there.\nThat is my job.
Please put yourself at ease!\nYour Doctor is here.
If you are hurt, please call me.\nI'll be there for you.
Please go easy on me.\nI just finished my night shift.
After all that work, let's relax\nwith some Pokémon battles!
Yawn... I'm sleepy...\nI can't stay awake any longer...
How are you and your Pokémon?
I will inject you with my energy!
People can do so much\nas long as they have energy!
A Gentleman should have\na liking for battles.
A Gentleman should bask\nin the elegant glow of his victory.
A Gentleman should accept the result of\na battle with a stoic mind.
I will evaluate your ability.
Hm... As a Trainer, you are\nat the level of a Preschooler.
Hmm... As a Trainer, you are\nat the level of Pokéfans.
You can learn a lot from mature women,\nsuch as wisdom and good manners.
Woohoo! Were you knocked out by\nthe Socialite's charm?
Did you enjoy the battle with me?
Oh-ho! Let's have a unique\nand elegant battle.
Ah-ha! I was not confident, \nbut this is a delightful surprise.
Eeeeee! I'll remember this!
Obedient Pokémon, selfish Pokémon...\nPokémon have unique characteristics.
You should not get angry at your Pokémon,\neven when you lose.
It is important to nurture and train\neach Pokémon's characteristics.
Do you discipline your Pokémon?\nPampering them too much is no good.
You need to discipline Pokémon you\nlove when they are misbehaving.
Too much praise can spoil\nboth Pokémon and people.
Pokémon never betray you.\nThey will return the love you give them.
This proves my love has been received\nby my Pokémon.
It's about time for me to give someone\nmy affection, though.
Shall I give you a tip for\ntraining good Pokémon?
The tip for training good Pokémon is\nto catch good Pokémon.
You don't seem to need any tips\nfor training good Pokémon.
Glad you made it! It won't be\nan easy job from here.
Haha! You see!?\nYou are not ready yet.
Earlier I got a little carried away,\nbut what job was I talking about?
Both my mom and dad are Ace Trainers.\nSo I am an Ace, too!
I want to be an Ace Trainer like\nmy mom and dad.
Waaaa! I should have superior genes and\nbe able to ride on my parents' coattails...
I don't mind your lack of focus, but you\nwill get no sympathy from me if you lose.
Ah, you see! You did not focus\non the battle. That's why you lost.
That is quite enough. It's over.\nDon't stare at me!
Dad... Mom...\nI'll have a battle. Look...
Dad... Mom...\nDid you see me? I won... I won!
Dad... Mom...\nWhat shall I do?
I came here to goof off.\nI don't want to cram for the big test...
I cannot lose...\nI don't want to study anymore.
No! I don't want to go home!\nI don't want to study!
I just want to be successful\nand grow rich someday.
My dream is simply to be rich.
I will be rich someday and\nput you to shame.
I don't care who you are\nor where you come from.
How should we act?\nThat is all that matters, isn't it?
A label is not important, is it?\nAfter all, you are you, aren't you?
Pokémon battles and study sessions\nare much the same. Let's be efficient!
You are too inefficient.\nYou need to be more quick and responsive.
How did I lose against such a slacker?\nI cannot believe it!
I have money to burn,\nso I don't want anything.
The only thing I enjoy\nis a Pokémon battle...
Just because I am rich\ndoes not mean I am especially happy.
Yes! I am a Rich Boy!
Well, good-bye!\nYou have been beaten by a Rich Boy!
Thank you! Merci!\nYou defeated a Rich Boy!
I just battle for fun,\nbut I'll do my best.
Well, I only won by chance.\nPlease pay it no mind.
It's good when you battle for fun.\nIf it's too serious, you won't enjoy it...
Yesterday was a party. Today is a\nbattle. I am rich. I always have fun!
I do not have to work,\nbecause I am loaded with cash.
All play makes me a dull girl.\nDo you think I don't know that?
I'm proud of these Pokémon!\nGo on, rush the enemy position!
My Pokémon are mighty!\nI will carve my name in history!
I won't cry... I won't.\nSomeday, I will be able to win.
I came here for my big brother\nwho always hides in his room.
My big brother the hermit,\nI won for you! Come out and play!
I wish my brother would\ncome out of his room and play with me...
Hello me old china,\ntime for the rhyma!
Bit of a Pokémon read and write,\nTrainer, many clinks!
Even if you dipper, you'll be fine.\nBest of friar, Trainer!
All Dad and Mom do is mumble\nat their computers! That's no fun!
I don't like Dad, or Mom, or computers!\nAll I need are my Pokémon!
Instead of mumbling to computers,\nI wish they would talk to me...
A globe-trotting young adventurer.\nThat's me!
Seeing Pokémon all over the world is\nthe purpose of my journey.
Adventure is calling me.\nFarewell! See you again!
Let's take it easy\nwith Pokémon and with life.
It's OK to bust your tail. But you need\nto have some breathing room.
No problem. No problem.\nI will have another chance.
I've traveled 3,000 miles searching\nfor a husband! A journey to nowhere.
Please let me know if there is a rich,\nwealthy, or affluent gentleman!
My goal is a wedding band...\nBut is that really a utopia?
A game is life,\nbut life is not a game.
I am always serious. You cannot win\nif you think this is just a game.
I'll give up games forever and set out\non a journey... Just kidding!
I'll always work part-time, because\nit lets me focus on what I really love.
You have only one life to live.\nAre you doing what you want to do?
I want to play here forever\nwithout being tied down.
I took this job 'cause I wanted to see\nsmiles on people's faces.
Don't look at me like that.\nSmile! Smile!
It's very frustrating,\nbut I am glad I saw you smile.
Let's start a battle already!\nWe are wasting time.
What? Is it already over?\nWe still have lots of time.
We ran out of time.\nWe cannot go into overtime!
I am battling here to promote\nthe café where I work.
You are not that strong,\nso you are not really right for my café.
Yowza! What a strong Trainer!\nSee you at my café next time, OK?
Join the Pokéfans.\nYour life will be happy!
If you join the Pokéfans,\nyou'll be strong like me!
If you join the Pokéfans,\nyour life will be saved!
I am not a regular Pokéfan.\nI am a major mega-Pokéfan!
I love Pokémon.\nI love love Pokémon!
You'll remember this!\nI am a big Pokéfan!
I think I am a Pokéfan,\ntherefore I am a Pokéfan.
The Pokéfan is power.
You should remember this.\nI am a Pokéfan.
There are young and beautiful people,\nbut youth is different from beauty.
If I had known that when I was young,\nI would not have a hard time now...
Youth is just youth.\nI wish I had realized it back then.
Ho there! You are a mountain standing\nin my way, aren't ya?
Yahoooooo!! Yahoooooooo!\nHear my cry of triumph!
Grrr... My victory has disappeared\nin a crevasse...
Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!\nI am a Hiker. I have a cult following!
Oh no? It's over already?\nHiker is bored!!
This is important, so remember this!\nDon't judge a book by its cover!
Despite my appearance, I am the head\nof a certain outfit. Don't tell anyone.
Don't tell anyone that I am playing here.
The boss does not have freedom.\nI feel like a captured Pokémon.
The truth is, I want to have a quiet life\nfishing all day, every day.
Ah... I don't want to do anything but fish.\nI am tired of winning and losing.
At my time of life, it doesn't matter\nif I win or lose.
Hello? Me? What, now?\nI am about to have a battle.
Hello? Can you hear me?\nI just won the battle.
Ah... Hello? Can you hear me?\nArgh! I lost...
He told me that I was like a squall,\nbut what is a squall?
W-wah! Wahhh!\nI am so happy that I am crying.
W-w-wahhhhh! Wahhhhh!\nWahhhhh! Wahhhhh!
No need to chat with someone\nI'm about to battle.
Life is over if you lose.\nThat's why I hold out.
Don't look at miserable me!\nGo away!
You have your way.\nI have my way.
I will go my way 'cause\nI don't have any other way.
Your way must be rocky.\nGood luck. I am behind you all the way.
Hey, you! Don't mess with me,\nor I will destroy your Pokémon!
Thought you might make trouble for me,\nbut what a wimpy attack!
How could I lose to such a wimpy move?\nGah, that bugs the snot out of me!
My dad and mom are both Veterans,\nbut I am a loser...
I wonder if my mom and dad will be sad\nif they see that I've become a Roughneck.
I cannot be like my mom and dad.\nSo I will live as a Roughneck.
My partner has turned to dust,\nbut his Pokémon is my Pokémon now.
Are you watching me, my long-lost partner?\nThat Pokémon of yours, we get along...
He was trash, but now he is eternal,\nlike the stars in the sky... Ah, my partner!
I am no good at speaking...\nSo my bike speaks...
Zooooom! Zoom whoosh!\nZooooom! Zoom zam!
Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!\nVrooooooooom! Vroom!
All right! Are you ready?\nDon't mess with a Biker!
I'm a Biker, so I'm more obsessed\nwith speed than anyone else!!
The truth is we are good guys.\nWe cannot do bad things at all!
Like uncooked dough,\nmy Pokémon are sticky!
Now you're stuck, aren't ya?
Well, your Pokémon are quite springy, too.
As I bake bread, I will bake your\nPokémon, too.
Oh my... Your Pokémon are like\nburned bread.
Ah, how frustrating and disappointing!\nYou burned me with that last move...
Just as I knead the dough,\nI'll knead you into shape.
Wanna be kneaded a little more?\nOr shall I sandwich you with bread?
Ooooo! I'll remember this!\nI'll turn you into a sandwich someday!
Laughing makes people feel better.\nThere seems to be scientific proof!
Haaa ha ha! Ha?\nWhat's wrong? Let's laugh!
Laugh at miserable me--I lost against\namazing you. Laugh and you'll feel better.
You think you can win against me?\nIt might not go as smoothly as you think.
Don't underestimate me just because\nI am a Harlequin.
No. This can't be happening.\nYou're not an ordinary person.
Observe my beautiful Pokémon magic!\nPlease watch closely!
I know a few gimmicks and tricks,\n'cause this is magic.
Tricks and magic are my bread and butter.\nAny Harlequin knows their worth!
Tedious talk is unnecessary...\nI will just break you...
What? Are you broken already?
Ugh, I'm broken...
I have low self-esteem,\nso I like someone to give me orders.
You are not my boss, so\nit doesn't matter even if you are weak.
Can I call you my boss?
This outfit is not a uniform,\nit's what I like to wear. I made it myself.
This is a uniform from an anime.\nDoesn't it look good on me?
I want to live in a world of games,\nanime, and comics forever.
I'm not cut out for a regular job,\nso I live on art.
I envy Pokémon, 'cause they are\ncarefree. I want to be a Pokémon.
Bah, if I can do a regular job,\nI will quit doing this stinking art.
Every time a Pokémon uses a move,\nmy heart will tremble!
Nothing stirs the soul\nmore than Pokémon moves.
Aha! Pokémon moves are so beautiful!\nI could almost faint!
I will make you cry,\n'cause you just don't know when to quit.
A state of deep sorrow and confusion\ncan also be art.
Someday, you will appreciate the value\nof defeat and sorrow.
Our job is hard,\n'cause it's such physical work.
My work gave me these great muscles.
Don't underestimate the power of kids.\nLike I did with you!
Raising Pokémon and raising kids.\nBoth are very hard.
When my Pokémon do well like this,\nI forget my everyday troubles.
Even I raise them with tender care,\nbecause I am their Trainer...
Hey, you!\nI promise I will take it easy on you!
Heheh... I will take it easy on you. Heh.
Sometimes even grown-ups want\nsomeone to take care of them.
The job site is quite dangerous, but\nI'll have to keep working with Pokémon.
I have trained my Pokémon well,\nand it's ready to go to the job site.
Ugh. I cannot make money tomorrow\n'cause I am injured.
Welcome!
Only the winner!\nOnly the winner can celebrate.
Enough... That's enough...
I do menial work every single day.\nAm I just a cog in the machine?
I am well broken in. No snags slow down\nthe smooth running of this machine!
I may be happier than a person who\ncannot even be a cog in the machine.
Yo, kid! Are you new? I'm the Worker\nthat everybody is talking about.
If you don't know me, you're bogus!\nGood-bye! The Worker is heading out.
Kid! Remember me! I am the Worker\neverybody's talking about.
Well, let me introduce myself.\nThese are my little darlings.
How was it? My little darlings are tough and\ncute, aren't they?
Phew! Your little darlings are awesome, too!
Whir, whir, whir, whoooosh!
Ring-ring! Ding-ding!
Bam!
This is the very latest model,\na limited-edition, carbon-fiber Bicycle.
When you have good tools,\nyou feel better about yourself.
Don't! Please don't touch my Bicycle.\nYou'll cover it with your filthy fingerprints.
Speed is the key in a battle!\nDash! Dash! Dash!
If I compare how I'm feeling right now to a\nrace, it is just like crossing the finish line!
I cannot take your nonsense anymore!\nI am moving back to my mother's place.
Hey, you! Take out all the Pokémon\nyou have here!
Huh? That's all you have?\nAren't you hiding a few more Pokémon?
I see. There seems to be nothing\nsuspicious about you or your Pokémon.
I'll protect my peace by myself.
My peace remains protected.
Please don't disturb my peace and quiet.
I was born to work.\nThat is my destiny.
I will work, work, and work some more.\nI am happy only when I am working.
As a matter of fact, having battles\nis my job, too.
I'm-a lowest rank now, but\nI'm-a gonna be at the top someday!
I'm-a gonna be the brightest star\nin the business! Top of the world, ma!
You work it like a shining star!\nI'm not gonna lose, I'm not gonna lose!
I have an ambition!\nI will take over the company!
All this serves my ambition!\nIt brings my sweet victory one step closer!
I was obsessed with the golden prize,\nwith my glittering ambition!
I am treated as an idol at the office.\nEverybody pampers me.
Everybody works for me,\nso I have nothing to do.
The truth is I don't like brushing my teeth\nor taking a bath, but don't tell anyone.
You look dusty.\nI'll give you a good scrub!
OK, you look a little bit cleaner now!
Hey! Don't run away!\nYou need to be scrubbed more!
These fruits of stubbornness were raised\nstubbornly by a stubborn old man.
This stubborn old man raised them.\nMy persistence is different from yours!
There's a fine line between persistence\nand stubbornness. I may retire soon.
I'm good at driving, but\nI'm not good at dealing with Pokémon.
Oh, it went unexpectedly well.\nBy any chance, am I a technician?
My train does what I need. It's harder to\nconvince living Pokémon to do things my way.
I've never left this place even once\nsince I was born.
I wonder if I will live here\nfor the rest of my life...
I wonder how long I will stay here...\nWhat is there outside this world?
I say this as a Doctor.\nFirst of all, you must save money.
Money cannot buy health.\nBut you cannot stay healthy if you're poor.
Because without money, you can neither\neat healthy food nor go to see a Doctor.
As you can see, I am a Doctor,\nbut I've never examined a patient.
I've studied to become a Doctor,\nbut I faint when I see blood.
I am a Sunday Doctor,\nrather like a Sunday driver.
Can you understand\nwhat medical personnel need?
What a Doctor needs is love--\nthe rush of unconditional love.
Medical service is love.\nCan you be a Doctor?
I took this job because I wanted\nto be needed by someone.
My job is hard,\nbut I am happy to help people.
When a patient leaves the hospital,\nI feel happy but a bit sad.
Grown-ups have a lot of hobbies.\nActually, I am a uniform collector.
I am not a Nurse.\nI wear this uniform just for fun.
You realized that I am a fake Nurse!\nYes, I am just a uniform collector.
Even if you are injured, I will treat you.\nSo let's fight hard.
Sorry! I went too far. Do you require\nimmediate hospitalization?
You went too far! I will bill you\nthe cost of my medical expenses!
I raised these very special Pokémon\nusing a special method.
Pokémon will be strong or weak\ndepending on how you raise them.
Ugh... It wasn't supposed to be like this.\nDid I blend the essence wrong?
Shall I share an exclusive tip\nfor training great Pokémon?
You'll be perfect if you buy my book\nof Pokémon training tips.
You'll be fine if you buy my DVD\nof Pokémon training tips.
Pokémon are my family!\nSee the solidarity of my family!
Well done, brothers and sisters!\nOur family solidarity is invincible!
NO! My family!\nWhat have you done?!
What you like and what you're good at\nare different, or at least separate.
I am good at battling,\nbut I don't enjoy it very much.
If you like what you do as a job,\nyou have a sense of fulfillment, don't you?
In summary, you cannot win against me.
You see, you cannot win, because\nyou are very weak.
Hummmm... You are good.\nYou are really pretty good.
Don't underestimate me because I'm old.\nI'll show you my rejuvenating attack!
I'm old but still going strong!\nI can take care of myself!
What a cruel way to treat a helpless\nold man! Shame on you!
I would like to retire soon. But I have\nno one to carry on the family tradition...
If I had a child like you,\nmy golden years would be carefree...
I wish my son were\nas mature as you are.
I feel sad when I see a young and\nbright child like you.
The first flush of youth...\nYou are too bright for me...
Sparkling eyes, firm skin...\nI won't get them back.
Hey! It's me. It's me!\nI am the best Pilot in the world!
How's that? Pwned!!
You! Who are you?!\nDo you know who I am?
I'm at the top of the heap! I'm a man\nwho always wants to come in first.
Remember this! My favorite words\nare "top of the heap."
You. Well done!\nSee you! I'll remember this!
I won't back down, lose, or fail!\nNo defeat for a Clerk ⑭.
Uh-huh!
Uuugh... Well done...\nYou made me fall to my knees...
I can do it! I can do anything!\nI will do it! I will do it!
Yes! I did it! I can do it!\nI can do it! I can doooooooo it!
But I listened to my Teacher's advice.\nI can't lose! I can't!
My research will lead this world\nto peace and happiness.
I am a genius. I will control\nthe future of the world!
I am a genius... I am not supposed\nto lose against someone like you...
Only research is left in my life.\nI abandoned my family and friends.
It's not bad to devote my whole life\nto research, is it?
Dedicating yourself to something\ncan cause loneliness.
Hyuck-yuck-yuck... Please lend me\na hand for my experiment.
Hyuck-yuck-yuck... I did it.\nThe experiment was a huge success.
Ho-hum. This is not good...\nThis experiment was a failure...
You must face off against\nmy extremely powered-up Pokémon!
Well, this is a natural outcome.\nThe power of science is awesome.
Your Pokémon have even more awesome\nstrength than the power of science.
If you lose, I'll have you help me\nin my latest experiment!
Ho hi ho. You lost! You will help science\nas my new assistant.
Pah. I was sooo close to signing you up\nas my new assistant.
Why do people compete and fight?\nThis is the subject of my research.
Even if you win, you will hurt your\nopponent's feelings.
If you lose, you may resent your opponent.
Hi! Focus!
Foooooooooooo!
Eeek!
Speech can be utter nonsense.\nPretty words only taint battles...
Trainers who treat battles as a sport\nare the height of vileness...
Defeat is worth nothing.\nLosers don't need words...
He-he-he. If you lose,\nI will turn you into a Pokémon.
He-he-he. Well, from today on,\nyou are already a Pokémon.
Next time I see you, I will turn you\ninto a Pokémon with my power.
Argh... I have a headache...\nI have such a headache...
I don't need psychic powers.\nPlease stop this headache...
If I don't keep using my power for battles,\nmy headache won't go away...
I claim that I am a Psychic,\nbut I cannot use psychic powers.
I am camouflaging it\nwith my Psychic-ish costume.
I go to magic classes\nto look like a Psychic.
...Grrr... Yeeek!!\nAn evil spirit! Go away!!
OK! The evil spirit\nthat possessed you has disappeared.
Evil spirit!\nLeave the Trainer at once!
I praise your courage for challenging me!\nI am the one with the strongest kick.
Haha... I probably did not have to use\nmy strongest kick on you.
Oh... The Pokémon did the fighting.\nMy strong kick didn't help a bit.
'Suuup! I'll give it all I've got!\nLet's do our best!!
'Sup! That's enough!\nPlease value your life!
'Suuuuup! Good work. I tried everything\nI could, but I'm disappointed.
Yo!
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Yo!
You don't have to impress me.\nYou can lose against me.
Come. Sleep quietly in my arms...
It's sad to say good-bye,\nbut we're running out of time.
Are you ready?\nI'll take the gloves off.
Well, well... You're not even in my league.\nThis is like bullying.
Aww... I cannot believe I lost!\nWho are you?!
I would like to do the fighting\ninstead of my Pokémon if I could.
Pokémon battles are not enough of a\nchallenge. I want to make this personal.
Ah, I tingle with excitement.\nI would like to fight...
Halt at once! You over there!\nLet us cross lances!
Trainer, you are at my mercy!
Trainer, I yield! \nPlease spare me. Please!
When I am surrounded by nature,\nmost other things cease to matter.
I won. But victory is nothing,\ncompared to the vastness of nature...
It doesn't matter to the vastness\nof nature whether I win or lose...
Despite my appearance, I am a city boy.\nSo I yearn for country life.
Do you have a hometown?\nIf so, you should go back and visit there.
I don't have a hometown to go back to,\n'cause I was born and raised in the city.
It's my mission to protect nature\nand all Pokémon living there!
If villains disturb the natural order,\nI will put them all in jail!
Protect Mother Nature!\nOtherwise, I will put you in jail!
We need a lot of money to protect\nMother Nature and her Pokémon.
Please donate money for a rich natural\nenvironment and for the Pokémon.
We protect forests and Pokémon by\nsaving money and planting trees.
Let me stop your winning streak here.
Ah. You still have much to learn.\nLet me give you a crash course!
You didn't win alone. You couldn't have won\nwithout your Pokémon.
You seem to be quite confident.\nI'll sink you straight away.
I am devoting my body and soul\nto Pokémon battles!
AAAAAAAAH! I am sooooo scared!\nI will never do it again... Sorrrry!
I'm working very hard, but\nthat doesn't mean I am strong.
You're a strong Trainer,\nso I think I was just lucky this time.
Even I can lose?!\nBut I'm a battling genius!
I started battling just to be cool, but\nI became an Ace before I knew it.
People can become strong if they have\nclear goals. That's the way it goes.
I'm still not popular even though\nI've been recognized as an Ace.
The lead character of this story...\nI'll tell you who it is!
The lead character of the story is me!\nYou are just an extra!
Of course, you are the lead character!
We would like to hold a Pokémon battle\nagainst the strongest foe.
We cannot believe we spent time\non such a childish battle! Leave at once!
Ho-ho-ho! That is to our liking!\nWe find ourselves quite satisfied!
A person who wants to fight, fight, and\nfight forever. That's the way of the Ace.
However hard they battle, they won't be\nsatisfied. That is a real Trainer, isn't it?
Your fighting style suits you very well.\nYou can be an Ace Trainer.
I can see despair in your eyes.\nBring it on!
It was a waste of time, much as I suspected.\nYou should start training all over again.
Did I underestimate you as just a little kid?\nOr was this your true ability?
Hey, you, young Trainer.\nI am utterly stylish, aren't I?
I am so stylish,\nI hypnotize myself! Step back!
I'm a wreck. I'm adrift. It just kills me.\nIt is hard to be too stylish.
I won't lose against a kid like you,\nwho doesn't know anything about battles.
After all, you are an amateur. No sweat.\n(Whew... That was a little too close!)
What? This kid is a fast learner?\nHa ha ha... I had no idea!
Argh. Cough, cough. I don't feel well.\nPlease show a little kindness.
I lied when I said I didn't feel well!\nVeterans do anything to win!
You're very sharp!\nYou did not fall for my illness act.
I will give you a taste\nof a Veteran's well-trained Pokémon.
How were the Veteran's Pokémon?\nDefeat is bitter, isn't it?
You have served me a spicy defeat.\nAnd yet defeat is also part of life.
Oh, you are so cute!\nCome, I promise to be nice in this battle.
You are so cute, really...\nI want to see you again. I'll be waiting.
Your battle is a little too cute.\nLet's play again sometime.
Oh, you are still a child.\nWho said you could come here?
You're not bad, but you're immature.\nCome back when you've learned something.
I thought you were a child.\nHee hee... You are tough...
Don't call me a Veteran!\nA woman's mind is always blooming.
I'm not finished with love or Pokémon.\nI'll stay fit and ready all my life.
I have pains in my eyes, my shoulder, and\nmy back, but my heart is forever young.
I am the strongest Backpacker.\nI have a lot of Pokémon in my Bag.
Hahaha! I am as big as my backpack,\naren't I? Aren't I?
I have more Pokémon in my Bag!\nWait, my Bag has a hole...
I am not traveling for freedom.
You're carrying bulky luggage,\nbut do you really need it?
My Bag is as wide as the sky.\nIn other words, my Bag is empty.
I haven't eaten anything for days.\nSpots are floating before my eyes...
Those aren't spots floating before my eyes.\nThose are glorious glimmers of victory!
Ah, I'm sinking fast. All I can think about\nis where my next meal is coming from...
Neither my husband nor I have money,\nso we are hitchhiking on our honeymoon.
Newly married, and such a big trip...\nI'm worried about our future.
On top of that, I have lost track of him...\nWhere can he be wandering?
Hey! Hey! \nPlease check out my cute Pokémon!
How about that?\nI'm proud of these Pokémon.
Oh no, don't bother them like that!\nPlease leave my Pokémon alone.
Being a Waiter is my disguise,\nand it helps me live quietly.
On my days off, the real me is ready.\nI'm an Ace Trainer!
I'm struggling to make a living,\nso I've been in disguise a long time.
My Pokémon are the strongest.\nI don't think I will lose.
Do you think you can win against me\nwith such wimpy Pokémon?
Ah... It's hard.\nIt sure is frustrating to lose.
Don't you think a restaurant\nfor Pokémon is a fun idea?
I wonder if people will like\na full-course meal for Pokémon.
It's a restaurant for Pokémon,\nnot a restaurant of Pokémon!
Harrumph! Haroooo!
Harooo!
Harrumph!!
I am the mountain range of your life!\nCross me if you can!
Haha! I am the summit, and the road\nto reach me is still very steep!
Finally, someone has climbed the mountain!\nThis is my summit!
If I lose, I'll spill the secret of fishing.\nIf I win, I'll tell you the essence.
The essence of fishing is to pull\nand reel in the fish--nothing else.
The secret of fishing is to wait without\nthinking, as if you were dozing off.
I always aim for a big fish!\nStay out of this if you are a small fish!
Reeling you in was hard work.\nYou put up a good fight!
Oh! What a great hit!\nBoth my arms and heart are electrified!
You look kind of mature.\nI like people like you.
Still, you look mature for your age.\nAre you already an adult, or are you a kid?
A man with the heart of a boy\nis just a wheedling child.
How much did this parasol cost?\nWhy, it is a cheap disposable.
I am a Parasol Lady, but I cannot\nspend money for a parasol.
A parasol is just a tool. It’s fine\nas long as it protects me from the rain.
I can really cut loose in Pokémon\nbattles without being scolded.
Nobody scolds me. That's why\nPokémon battles are the best!
You like a big fight, don't ya?\nYou are my pal.
My computer friends said I wouldn't be\ntaken lightly with this look.
I won, but I was so scared...\nMaybe I am not cut out for this.
Eeek... I should have played\nwith my computer in my room.
My ride and I\nare always together.
My ride helps me show off who I am.
My motorbike makes me feel better\nwhen I lose.
I don't have money to buy gas,\nso I have to push it with my feet.
I'm one of the Bikers,\nso my bike is crucial.
Ah... Dad, Mom.\nIt's hard to be a Biker...
Aah, I am so hungry that I am\ncompletely wiped out. What shall I do?
I'm working at a bakery, 'cause I want to\neat bread anytime I want.
Aah! I crashed from my sugar high!\nSomeone give me a pastry!
OK, I will do it! \nI am excited about this!
Blast!
I'll remember this!
I'll confuse you with my smooth moves.\nA-one, a-two, cha cha cha!
You could not focus on the battle,\n'cause you were watching my smooth steps!
And one, and two, and twirl, and...\nAh, that didn't work at all! 
Sorry to keep you waiting.\nYour idol, Harlequin, Harlequin.
Thank you very much.\nIt was Harlequin, Harlequin.
It was Harlequin, Harlequin.\nThank you for your support.
If you lose, you can be my servant.
From now on, I am your employer.
I'll make you my servant someday.
Ahhhh... So strange.\nI feel very, very tired.
I still feel kind of blah.\nI'm all achy...
I really feel blah.\nWell, I will go home now.
A child like you cannot understand\nthe beauty that I am pursuing.
I am a servant of beauty.\nUgly defeat does not suit me.
Perhaps the beauty I've been looking for...\nis you?
I paint pictures and live with Pokémon.\nI am enjoying my life!
The sting of defeat will be a good\nmemory as you grow older.
Experience hardships when you are young,\n'cause old bodies cannot take them.
My schoolkids are sleeping.\nI'm shooting for the top during nap time!
Oh, no!\nLook at the time!
After nap time comes snack time.\nI have to go back to preschool soon.
Life is full of so many farewells,\nso I will enjoy the present.
I cannot see you again,\nso I will do my best.
This is a woman's life.\nCan a baby like you understand it?
If you work diligently,\nyou will get results.
You, keep trying.\nMaster the basics.
Well, even if you work diligently,\nthings don't always go well.
I've arrived from a distant island.\nMay I please trouble you for a battle?
I have won.
I was utterly inexperienced. I'd be \ngrateful if I could be your pupil.
I am so obsessed with Pokémon\nthat my wife is as mad as a hornet.
Pokémon battles are so much fun.\nNo way I can quit.
I don't want to go home, 'cause my wife\nis as scary as a legendary Pokémon.
Our lives have plenty of ordinary days.\nI gotta have Pokémon!
Only Pokémon rescue me\nfrom boring and monotonous days.
When I look at a special person like you,\nI just melt.
I used to be like you.\nI was full of hopes and dreams.
Dreams are important.\nBut if all you have is your dreamworld...
Just having hopes and dreams is not enough.\nWhat is important is... Never mind.
I want to have an exhilarating battle.\nGot it?
Thank you!\nA battle is extremely exhilarating!
OK, OK, I got it...\nLet's call it a day.
It's OK if I have training wheels.\nIt’s OK if my Bike doesn't accelerate.
It's OK if you go your own way.\nYou'll reach your goal someday.
It's OK if you lose.\nIt's OK, 'cause you have a Bicycle.
You ain't never even gonna see\nmy Pokémon's moves.
You're slow, ain't ya?
You're right quick! \nWho are ya, anyways?
I just got married, and we'll be\nexpanding our family soon.
You know what I need.\nCan you spare a few dollars?
Oh, I should really get home,\nbut Pokémon battles are so much fun...
Take a good look\nat this Clerk ⑭'s sheer strength!
You got me!\nYou have the best skills in the world!
I put on a smile when I'm crying inside.\nThat's a Clerk ⑭'s sad smile.
I will show you the harsh side\nof Pokémon battles.
That's not good.\nI was too generous today.
Did you burn the image of my Pokémon\ninto your mind?
Who do you think I am?\nI am a mighty Policeman!
That's for disobeying me!\nI am a big guy!
You won a battle against a Policeman...\nI will arrest you someday.
It's embarrassing, but I wasn't\nwell behaved when I was young.
You lack energy despite your youth.\nShall I train you?
Good, good. Misbehave while you're still\nyoung and you can get away with it.
Squeak! Squeak, squeak, squeak...\nHm? What? Wanna fight?
You're so impatient.\nI'm still in the middle of my work.
Ohh dear... You tracked dirt\non the floor I just finished cleaning...
There are only two roads in life.\nThe one you like, and the one you hate.
I'll choose the road I like,\neven though it is not the quickest route.
Actually, the road you hate\nmay be the shortcut to your goal.
I am a train.\nI will just run on the tracks.
You are a station where I don't stop.\nI will just pass you by.
I think the train is great, because it runs\nthe same route over and over.
You're good at your job\nand very strong.
I expected too much from you.\nYou are lucky that this is not business.
A person who can juggle\nwork and play is pretty cool.
I've been with these Pokémon\nsince I was a child.
Pokémon are like family to me.
I don't think I want to have children.\nI'd rather focus on my Pokémon family.
Hi, I am a physician!\nHey! Let me give you a shot!
Come now, let me give you a shot!\nDon’t worry. It won't hurt!
You have strong arms!\nSo let me give you a shot now!
Cough! Cough, cough! How many\nmore people will I be able to save?
Cough! I wanted to save more people.\nCough, cough!
Few physicians live well...\nCough! I can't go on any longer...
Do you want a shot?\nOr an IV drip?
You want both a shot and an IV.\nYou are greedy!
Argh. It's sickening!\nYou're such a drip.
In this job,\nI've seen a lot of strange things.
I don't know why, but Ghost-type \nPokémon seem attracted to me.
Ahhh, I lost... By the way,\nwho is that standing behind you?
I have raised them too long.\nThey are beyond my control...
It's over...\nNobody can stop them...
Finally, they calmed down...\nYou saved me. Thank you!
I will test the Pokémon\nyou have been training.
Bah! Is that the best you can do?\nI expected more from you...
Wow! You are awesome!\nWhat great Pokémon you've trained!
Take a look at these Pokémon--I raised\n'em myself. They make me right proud.
I am right proud of these Pokémon.\nThey're my friends and my treasures.
You are a strong one, sure enuff.\nBut I don't intend to lose next time!
I am the top Breeder.\nI can tame any kind of Pokémon.
You see? My Pokémon are very loyal, \naren't they?
They are too attached to me.\nThey are not fit for battling.
Arghhhh! Who is gentle?!\nI will bring you down!
Arghh! Arghh! \nI am NOT a Gentleman!
Arghh! You! You'll regret this!\nI will bring you down someday!
My brother told me once...\nEyes! Aim for the eyes!
What my brother told me was right...\nThanks... Bro...
I lost against a kid. Bro...\nI should have listened to you...
I can't drop my luxurious lifestyle just\nbecause I'm older. Nothing can stop it.
It may be a hard truth for a child,\nbut money makes the world go round.
I cannot drop the habits\nI learned when I was young.
I am a late bloomer and a crazy bloomer.\nI'll bloom and dazzle you!
Dance, bloom, and blossom!\nA woman who flowers and triumphs!
I want to blossom and fall\nrather than dying on the vine.
Hey, it's me. It's me!\nI am the best Pilot in the world!
No! That's no good!\nYou cannot reach the top that way.
Good. You're daring!\nI'll let you come fly on my plane.
Hey! Yo! It's me.\nI am the best Pilot in the world.
Listen! A Trainer should be No. 1.\nThat's it!
You're quite a Trainer!\nBe my apprentice!


















Thank you for riding\nthe Battle Subway today.\xF000븀\x0000\nI am the Subway Boss Ingo.\xF000븁\x0000\nI will choose the next destination\nbased on your talent.\xF000븁\x0000\nDo you understand Pokémon well?\nCan you hold on to your principle?\xF000븀\x0000\nWill you go on to victory or defeat?\xF000븁\x0000\nAll aboard!
Ah. Your battle was not bad at all.\xF000븁\x0000\nHowever, we seem to have done slightly\nbetter than you.\xF000븁\x0000\nWe would really like to battle with you again!\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease ride the Battle Subway again!
