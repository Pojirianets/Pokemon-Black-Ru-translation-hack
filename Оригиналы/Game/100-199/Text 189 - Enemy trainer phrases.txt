A Trainer catches another Trainer's eye.\nThat is the start of a Pokémon battle!\xF000븁\x0000
What?!\nYou are too strong!
I'll go into the tall grass and\nhave battles with wild Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut, before that, I have to visit\nthe Pokémon Center to heal up my team.
I really love Pokémon battles!\xF000븁\x0000\n'Cause my cute Pokémon will do its best\nin a really cute way!\xF000븁\x0000
Even though it lost,\nmy Pokémon is still cute!
I'll make my cute Pokémon even stronger\nby having battles with lots of Trainers!
Lillipup, Lillipup!\nMy Lillipup! Go!\xF000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon uses those kinds of moves?!
Different Trainers use\ndifferent kinds of Pokémon!\xF000븀\x0000\nThat's fun to see, isn't it?
Check out how much my Pokémon\nhave grown up!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh. I guess they're still pretty green.
You are great!\nThis is a present for you.\xF000븁\x0000
Thank you very much.\xF000븁\x0000\nI learned a lot about how I should\ntrain my Pokémon from battling you.
Your Pokémon look quite good!\xF000븁\x0000\nWould you show me how\nyou've been training them?\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, I see!\nYou've trained them by traveling together!
Please, let your precious Pokémon\nhave this.\xF000븁\x0000
I guess when Pokémon and Trainers\nspend that much time together,\xF000븀\x0000\nthey naturally understand each other!
I feel invincible because I am surrounded\nby the smiles of children and Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
Wow! Great, great!\nYou are very strong!
Speak while making eye contact, and\nexpress your feelings to each other...\xF000븀\x0000\nIt's the same for people and Pokémon.

Kumi: Come on, Pokémon! Get up! Go!\nAmy: Oh, no! Our Pokémon burned out...

Eh? Only one Pokémon?\nAre you really a Trainer?



You have only one Pokémon?\nAre you really a Trainer?
Hey! Trainer!\nHave a battle with me!\xF000븁\x0000
Oops. I have no healthy Pokémon\nleft to fight...
Argh! You went all out against a kid!\n...Actually, that's a good thing. Thanks!
Take this!\nHyper Beam!\xF000븁\x0000
Whoops...
Hyper Beam?\nOh, my Pokémon can't really use it yet.\xF000븁\x0000\nI don't know very much about Pokémon,\nso I just want to use really cool moves.
Trainer! \nI wanna play with you.\xF000븁\x0000
Trainer!\nYou too strong!
When I get big, I wanna be\na strong, cool Trainer, too!
Now I get to show off everything\nI learned in the Trainers' School!\xF000븁\x0000
Argh...
I was so overwhelmed by your greatness\nthat I forgot everything I learned!\xF000븀\x0000\nI need to keep my wits during a battle.
I was just thinking\nabout a new battle strategy!\xF000븁\x0000
A new battle strategy only works\nif you stick with it...
I know all kinds of things! Like if you\nwalk through the swaying tall grass,\xF000븀\x0000\nyou might find a cool Pokémon!
Even if Pokémon have not been fully\ntrained, they can show their potential\xF000븀\x0000\ndepending on their Trainer's style.\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, that's really frustrating!
I feel sorry for Pokémon when they lose\nbecause their Trainer lacks skill...\xF000븀\x0000\nA Trainer has a huge responsibility.
The fun of traveling around the world\nis having serious battles\xF000븀\x0000\nwith a lot of Pokémon I meet!\xF000븁\x0000
Wooo! You're a top-class Trainer,\nthe best in the world!\xF000븀\x0000\n...But what do I know?
As long as my Pokémon are with me,\nI can battle Trainers all over the world!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe world is so big! Woooooo!\nThat's really exciting!
Where did you come from?\nMe? Well, if you can win, I'll tell you!\xF000븁\x0000
My first battle...\nAnd I lost...
To tell you the truth,\nI just left Castelia City yesterday.\xF000븀\x0000\nI've just started Pokémon battling, too.
I'm still a rookie, but someday\nI will be a great player!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll improve by having a lot\nof Pokémon battles!\xF000븁\x0000
Ugh!\nI missed the rebound!
I won't make excuses for losing!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhy waste time dreaming up excuses?\nI'll spend that time getting stronger!
A young Trainer! It's important for the\nyoung to get lots of exercise, isn't it?\xF000븁\x0000
A good sweat...\nBoy, I am glad that I am an athlete!
I want a Poké Ball that's\nas big as a basketball!\xF000븁\x0000\nI think it would be more comfortable\nfor the Pokémon inside it.
You've been caught by a powerful hook,\nwhich is me!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll have a battle with you using\nmy freshly caught Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, no! The one who was caught...\nwas me!
I usually release the Pokémon I catch.\nThat's called catch and release!\xF000븀\x0000\nWhen I release them, I say these words:\xF000븁\x0000\nFarewell, Pokémon.\nIt was a nice fight.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll say these words to you, too.\nIt was a nice fight!
OK! Good catch! Good catch!\nMy next catch will be called victory!\xF000븁\x0000
The victory that got away\nwas thiiiiiiiiiis big!
Catch, caught, and catch again...\nLife is fishing!
Ho there! Even in the middle of\nconstruction, a Trainer will battle.\xF000븁\x0000
Gah! I'm digging myself into a big hole!
If you use a Pokémon move called Dig,\nyou can get out of a cave instantly!
I'm a mucho macho Worker!\nI'll bring you down with my muscles!\xF000븁\x0000
Argh!\nThe impudence!
I dismissed you as just a kid...\nNot at all... You're quite a Trainer!
A battle is like a construction project.\nThey're both a piece of cake for me!\xF000븁\x0000
Ooh... That piece of cake was\nhard to swallow!
I may have lost in the battle, but I bow\nto nobody when it comes to construction!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou must have something like that, right?\nSomething you do better than anybody?
We've trained by doing physical work!\nOur attacks are super powerful!\xF000븁\x0000
We've trained by doing physical work.\nSo even when we lose, we're powerful!
This Worker is happy to have a job that\nlets him be with his favorite Pokémon!
Hi, Trainer!\nLet me turn you into a work of art!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, I just got whitewashed!
The reason why there are so many colors\nin this world...white, black, red, green,\xF000븀\x0000\nblue, yellow...is that they can be mixed\xF000븀\x0000\nto create an explosion of new color!\xF000븁\x0000\nBoom!
As my mind roams, as the wind blows,\ndestiny has brought us to this battle.\xF000븁\x0000
Urgh... I didn't know\nI was flying against the wind...
I want to fly around the Unova region,\nblown by the wind!
This big bag...\nWhat do you think is inside?\xF000븁\x0000
I lost, but now I have more things\nto add to my bag.
I'll tell you a secret. The things I put\nin the bag are memories of my journey!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe things you can't see are very heavy!
These Pokémon usually help me bake.\nToday, they'll help me battle you!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, my...\nIt was a tasty battle.
I get on well with my Pokémon, and we\nbake bread together. It's so much fun!\xF000븀\x0000\nI don't mind getting up early every day.
Turn around, and it's my turn. ♪\nTurn around, and it's your turn.\xF000븁\x0000
Turn around, turn around, turn around...
It's difficult to have a battle while\ntapping my toes.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut I am a Dancer!\nIt is natural to dance!
I will show you all the moves\nthat my Pokémon have mastered!\xF000븁\x0000
I am sorry that I underestimated\nyou and your Pokémon's moves!
Sometimes a battle is so beautiful\nthat it takes your breath away.\xF000븁\x0000\nOurs was such a battle!
It is best to try anything!\nYou think so, too, don't you?\xF000븁\x0000
There's a rhythm to attacking\nand defending...\xF000븀\x0000\nI think ours got thrown off.
The guitar is expression itself.\xF000븁\x0000\nLet's enjoy playing the guitar,\nrather than just talking about it!\xF000븁\x0000\nA Pokémon is also expression itself.\nLet's enjoy battling!
I cannot see the future yet...\nThe world is still to be determined...
Plasmaaaa!\n...What? Did we lose?
I cannot believe that Team Plasma\nlost to such kids!
I've finally become a Trainer...\nEverything starts from here!
It's not over yet! I've been studying\nPokémon to prepare for this moment!
Ah! So that's a Pokémon battle!
I've finally become a Trainer...\nEverything starts from here!
It's not over yet! I've been studying\nPokémon to prepare for this moment!
Ah! So that's a Pokémon battle!
I've finally become a Trainer...\nEverything starts from here!
It's not over yet! I've been studying\nPokémon to prepare for this moment!
Ah! So that's a Pokémon battle!
Eek! Ouch!\nI won't let you get away with that!
I'm kinda nervous, and\nthis isn't going well at all!
The Pokémon on both sides did their best!
Eek! Ouch!\nI won't let you get away with that!
I'm kinda nervous, and\nthis isn't going well at all!
The Pokémon on both sides did their best!
Eek! Ouch!\nI won't let you get away with that!
I'm kinda nervous, and\nthis isn't going well at all!
The Pokémon on both sides did their best!
More!\nLet me hear the voice of your Pokémon!
I never expected to hear\nPokémon say such things...
My Psychic-type Pokémon\njust started making noises.\xF000븁\x0000\nIs that because we're in the ruins...\nor is it because of you?\xF000븁\x0000
So...strong!\nWho are you?!
It is said that long ago, these ruins\nwere the heart of civilization for people\xF000븀\x0000\nand Pokémon in the Unova region.
Just being here fills me\nwith magical power...\xF000븁\x0000
You seem to be\nfull of magical power, too...
In ancient places,\nmagical energy remains...\xF000븁\x0000\nI can understand it.\nSo much sorrow and joy...
As if that would work on my Pokémon!
It's not over yet! One more left!\nThis is where I give it my all!
You got me.\xF000븁\x0000\nI am...burned...out...
I see...\nThat might be a good attack.
I'll put all of my hopes\non my last Pokémon!
Lose? Me?\nI don't believe this.
Ah!\nMy Pokémon!
Huh? Could it be?\nCould I have only one Pokémon left?
Er...\nIs it over now?
Welcome to Striaton Gym!\xF000븁\x0000\nCare for a taste of battle?\nI'll serve up the first course!\xF000븁\x0000
Yow!\nYou're a Trainer with a lot of pepper!
I think it is all right to move ahead\nwith Pokémon you've trained well, even\xF000븀\x0000\nwithout thinking about type matchups.
The specialty of Striaton Gym--\nthe full-course “Trainer de luxe!"\xF000븀\x0000\nI'm your second course.\xF000븁\x0000
That was one of our most popular dishes.\nDid you enjoy the battle?
The specialty of Striaton Gym--\nthe full-course “Trainer de luxe!"\xF000븀\x0000\nTo complete your repast--a Gym Leader.
Now, with that move, I'm starting to see\nwhat kind of Trainer you are!
No matter how grim the situation, I'll use my\nresearch skills to find a winning strategy!
My theory about you was correct.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou're more than just talented...\nYou're motivated! I salute you!
I hang around Nacrene Gym all the time.\nPeople call me a bookworm.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll warn you now... I am strong because\nI spend the entire day either\xF000븀\x0000\nreading books or training Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000
I may be a bookworm,\nbut I am not a bug Pokémon.
My first recommendation is a book called\n“Nice to Meet You, Pokémon."\xF000븁\x0000\nThe bookshelves for children's books\nare close to the entrance.
Oh, wow!\nI lost, but thanks for a great battle!
I've never known anyone so powerful.\nMy head is empty compared to yours!
Snick!\nMy switch was turned on!
Could it be time to bug out of here?\nNo, no. I refuse to be squashed!
Is it over?\nHas my muse abandoned me?
You and your Pokémon...\nare shining brilliantly!
A properly dramatic victory requires\na dash of danger and a pinch of peril.
I meant to make your head spin,\nbut you shocked me instead.
Even though I lost,\nI'm an ocean of calm...
Welcome, challenger!\xF000븁\x0000\nI will do you the greatest of honors\nand accept your challenge!\xF000븁\x0000
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll on!\nRoller coaster!
I was aiming for a fighting style\nthat overwhelms you with speed...\xF000븁\x0000\nIf I can move faster than my opponents,\nI will get the upper hand.
I lost, but I will think a lot harder,\nand that will make me a lot stronger!
Your fashion sense...\nIt's kind of Nuvema Town-ish.\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, no!\nI thought I'd be the fashionista!
Elesa controls an elegant Gym\nin elegant Nimbasa City.\xF000븀\x0000\nShe has an essential elegance.\xF000븀\x0000\nYou should be her fan, too!
I'll be!\nSure didn't see that coming.
Givin' up's the easy way out! If I wanted,\nI could have given up any old time!
Well, I've had enough... And just so you\nknow, I didn't go easy on you.
When I think about a match\nwith a fabulous Trainer like you,\xF000븀\x0000\nit's like I'm walking on air!
This is my last Pokémon...\nBut I'll never give up hope!
Being your opponent in battle is a new\nsource of strength to me. Thank you!
I became a Pilot, which has been\nmy dream since I was a child.\xF000븀\x0000\nI am extremely strong! Bring it on!\xF000븁\x0000
Altitude is dropping slowly...\nI will prepare for landing.
I became a Pilot, making the dream\nof my younger days a reality...\xF000븀\x0000\nThe weight is quite comfortable.
Target lock acquired!\xF000븁\x0000\nI will shoot you down\nwith my flight technique!\xF000븁\x0000
What?!\nI missed the target.
We can depend on a move that\nhits without fail when it counts.\xF000븁\x0000\nFor example, Aerial Ace and Swift\nare both surefire moves!
The best Trainer of Ice-type Pokémon\nin the Cold Storage...\xF000븀\x0000\nThat's me!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, no... I will train even harder\nat the Icirrus Gym.
The Gym Leader in Icirrus City\nuses Ice-type Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you train your body and mind there,\nyou'll be fine with cold!
The pure chill of the Cold Storage!\nTaste how cold it is!\xF000븁\x0000
Chilly?\nI feel the shiver pass along my spine.
There are a lot of Trainers,\neven in the Cold Storage.



We!\nWe are training here!\xF000븁\x0000\nNow let's train\nPokémon together!\xF000븁\x0000
Great!\nYou have a talent as a Trainer!
I want to win against Gym Leaders,\nbut I want to win against you, too!
My goal is to outperform Gym Leaders!\nCan you win against me?!\xF000븁\x0000
My Pokémon fought well, didn't they?
I have my goal!\nMy Pokémon are there for me!\xF000븀\x0000\nThat's why I can keep trying!
POWER!\xF000븁\x0000\nPower is essential for both\nPokémon and football!\xF000븁\x0000
Didn't I have enough power...?
I am training to be the very best\nwith my Pokémon!
An elegant Smasher\nhas an elegant battle!\xF000븁\x0000
E-e-even though I lost,\nI won't panic.
Because I am a lady, I won't\nbe chagrined at losing the battle!
The qualifying round is coming soon.\xF000븁\x0000\nI will practice smashes\nby using you as a wall!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, whew! Must...catch...my breath.\nThat was some good training...
You and I have just met!\nLet's start this game from the beginning.
One-two, one-two! Keep time with\neach other, and one-two punch!\xF000븁\x0000
Mayo: Two of us keeping time together...\nAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!\xF000븁\x0000\nMay: Two of us keeping time together...\nAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
It would be even greater if we knew\nwhat two Pokémon will do.
You've got only one Pokémon,\nso we cannot fight.
We discuss what to do\nbefore a battle.\xF000븁\x0000

What I've heard is it's good to use\nEarthquake when your ally is floating!
If you want to have a battle with us, \nyou need two Pokémon.
...Interrupting us!\nWhat a horrible Trainer!
If you take something away,\nI will take it back... Remember that!
Look, look! This is a Gym Badge\nfrom Striaton City!\xF000븁\x0000\nOh, you have it, too!\nThen let's have a Pokémon battle\xF000븀\x0000\nto see who is stronger!\xF000븁\x0000
Impressive! A battle with a\nGym Badge holder is different!
You know, there's a pedestal at the\nentrance of each Pokémon Gym.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you get that Gym's Badge,\nyour name will be carved there.
I patrol Pinwheel Forest every day!\nA battle here is a piece of cake!\xF000븁\x0000
What a huge mistake to lose\na battle in Pinwheel Forest!
A Ranger always has one of these.\nI'll give it to you!\xF000븁\x0000
The forest is alive...\xF000븁\x0000\nSomething changes every day,\nso it's fun to patrol!
Blend into the wilderness\nand talk to Pokémon with your heart.\xF000븀\x0000\nThat is a Ranger!\xF000븁\x0000
Did you feel my wildness?
I'm sure you can fully\nutilize this.\xF000븁\x0000
If you blend into the wilderness too well,\nyou won't be noticed by Pokémon,\xF000븀\x0000\nlet alone by people.\xF000븀\x0000\nThat is a problem...
Come on! Let's take\na deep breath.\xF000븁\x0000\nInhale, exhale.\nInhale, exhale.\xF000븁\x0000\nAll right! Next,\nlet our Pokémon fight!\xF000븁\x0000
In this situation...\nAll that comes out is a sigh...
Well, a sigh and this lovely gift for you!\xF000븁\x0000
Different Pokémon can be found\nin different places.\xF000븁\x0000\nDoes that mean there is\na perfect place for everyone?
Get great powers drawn from nature\nwithout opposing it.\xF000븀\x0000\nThat is the strength of Rangers!\xF000븁\x0000
You and your Pokémon make a great team!
This is one of the powers\nI got from nature.\xF000븁\x0000
Even the things you can't do alone,\nif you're with someone else...\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's right. We always\nhave Pokémon around us.\xF000븀\x0000\nIsn't that great?
Why do Pokémon and people\nstay together...?\xF000븀\x0000\nThat's the theme of my research.\xF000븁\x0000
A ray of light shone in...\nI feel a little like that.
Why do Pokémon and people\nstay together...?\xF000븁\x0000\nI think we stick together\nbecause we are different.
If I apply what I just learned\nto the battle, I think I can win!\xF000븁\x0000
I've even won against my teacher, though...
Knowing something and being\nable to do it seem pretty similar,\xF000븀\x0000\nbut they can be very different.
My Pokémon's strong points!\nYou'll see them if you fight!\xF000븁\x0000
Hey! Did you see\nmy Pokémon's strong points?!
My Pokémon's strong points?\xF000븁\x0000\nHmmm...\xF000븁\x0000\nI don't know 'cause there are too many!
When it's cold, wear a lot of clothes!\xF000븁\x0000\nOnly humans could come up\nwith something so clever!\xF000븁\x0000
How we struggle in vain at the end\nalso shows how clever humans are!
I'll tell you something clever.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you use a Fire-type move on a Pokémon\nthat is frozen solid, the ice will melt!
Although I am in the Cold Storage,\nmy heart is burning!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, no!
Some Pokémon grow stronger\nwhen they get colder,\xF000븀\x0000\nwhile some Pokémon love hot places.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's right! Everyone is different!\nEvery Pokémon is different!
You're pretty energetic,\nconsidering the cold place we're in!\xF000븁\x0000\nLet's warm up with a Pokémon battle!\xF000븁\x0000
I warmed up, but I lost the battle,\nand my heart is freezing...
I am storing thick fat\nto resist the cold.\xF000븁\x0000\n...I didn't just get fat.\nPlease don't get me wrong.
...\xF000븁\x0000\n...R-ready to b-battle?\xF000븁\x0000
...\xF000븁\x0000\n...I'm sh-shivering!
...\xF000븁\x0000\n...Kn-know what?\n...Th-this place is cold.
A traveling Backpacker\nmeets a traveling Trainer.\xF000븁\x0000
I may have been traveling\nto meet you... Just kidding!
My journey taught me that a journey\nis not just going somewhere.\xF000븁\x0000\nMeeting people and learning from them\nare both part of my journey.
I wanted to go to the Celestial Tower...\nbut I got lost and stranded.\xF000븁\x0000
Ah! I cannot go anywhere\nif I am stopping!
To go to the Celestial Tower...\xF000븁\x0000\nWalk along the road! That's right!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you keep walking, someday\nyou'll arrive at your destination.
Oh! A Pokédex!\xF000븁\x0000\nI see. That is the reason\nfor your journey!\xF000븁\x0000
Impressive! That's what you'd expect\nfrom the owner of a Pokédex!
I've heard that both Professor Junipers\nwere Backpackers when they were young.
My travel partner is a Pokémon\nthat a popular guidebook recommended!\xF000븁\x0000
The guidebook does not tell me\nhow to win.
According to the popular guidebook,\nNimbasa City is an entertainment city.\xF000븀\x0000\nIt must be full of fun!
Do you want to pass through here?\xF000븁\x0000\nThen, you must greet me!\xF000븁\x0000
You!!\nWhat great strength you have!
For a child like you, \na Bicycle is just right!\xF000븀\x0000\nIt is healthier, isn't it?
Heheh!\nNobody can beat my speed and fury!\xF000븁\x0000
I have lost!\nI am such a loser!
Ah! I wish I could fly down\na much, much bigger road.\xF000븀\x0000\nThe Pokémon would be happy, too!
Hey, hey, what have we here, boys?\xF000븁\x0000\nYou have good Pokémon.\nLet me see!\xF000븁\x0000
Jim: G-good Pokémon.\nTo be honest, they are dazzling!\xF000븁\x0000\nCas: WHAT?\nHow could bad men like us lose...?
There are good Pokémon,\nbut there are no bad Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nEverything is up to the Trainer.\nThat's what I think!
You've got only one Pokémon?\nA single battle is so boring!
Hey, hey! A bad one teamed up\nwith another bad one!\xF000븁\x0000\nDo you know what it means?\xF000븁\x0000\nThat means we are very bad!\xF000븁\x0000

Even bad men like us\ncan be friends!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat a great thing!\nFriendship between men\xF000븀\x0000\nand friendship with Pokémon...
What? You've only got one\nPokémon that can fight?\xF000븁\x0000\nI cannot take a cheap shot,\nfighting two against one!
I'm a little bit strong.\nI will work out!\xF000븁\x0000
I got worked over...
You're quite strong.\nYou have left the Little League!
Hey!\nHey, let's practice together!\xF000븁\x0000\nI have to warn you--I will go all out\neven if we are just practicing!\xF000븁\x0000
I was no match for you...\nThere is always someone better.
I promise you!\xF000븁\x0000\nI will learn from this experience\nand become an even better player!
There is no end\nto mastering Pokémon battles!\xF000븁\x0000
There is an end\nfor this battle!
It's hard to have no end,\nbut if you change your perspective,\xF000븀\x0000\nyou'll see we can enjoy them forever!
I want to know how\nthe fighting Pokémon feel.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's why I fight, too.\nThat's me, a Battle Girl!\xF000븁\x0000
When I lose, I cry with my Pokémon!\nThat's me, a Battle Girl!
When you train every day,\nyour body moves as you like.\xF000븀\x0000\nIt feels really good!
I test the challenge rock\nwith my fist every day!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt is important to make steady progress,\nlittle by little.\xF000븁\x0000
I still have not\ntried hard enough!
I test the challenge rock every day\nwith my Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhy don't you check out\nthe challenge rock\xF000븀\x0000\nwith a Fighting-type Pokémon?
I am pleased to meet you.\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease allow me to introduce you\nto my Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000
I had the honor of meeting\nyour Pokémon!
Well, well, you are strong!\nI admire you.\xF000븀\x0000\nI would like to learn by watching you!
Clerks exchange business cards.\xF000븁\x0000\nTrainers, of course, greet each other\nwith a Pokémon battle!\xF000븁\x0000
What an impressive greeting!\nThat was a great Pokémon battle!
When I was a child,\nI traveled with Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000\nOf course, I am still raising Pokémon!\n'Cause Pokémon are my friends for life!
My work is a Pokémon battle!\xF000븁\x0000
Today's work\ndidn't go well...
Our company develops goods\nfor Pokémon and Trainers.\xF000븁\x0000\nSo, Pokémon battles are also\nan important part of my work!
I received intense training from Clay.\xF000븁\x0000\nNo Trainer around here\nis out of my league.\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, no...\nI've found someone who's out of my league!
Clay is a Gym Leader and\na company president.\xF000븀\x0000\nAnd he scolds me all the time.
I was about to take a break,\nthen I met you!\xF000븁\x0000
This encounter was a good one...\nfor you!
I met my Pokémon\nmore than ten years ago.\xF000븀\x0000\nI trust them.
Even the battle I lost\nwill be a bittersweet memory...
Wow, you really cleaned up!
When Pokémon Trainers meet,\nwhat we do is, of course,\xF000븀\x0000\nengage in a Pokémon battle, don't we?\xF000븁\x0000
Oh no...\nI'm pathetic...
Perhaps I meet people here because of\nguidance from my Pokémon.
Oh?\nYou want to have a battle with me?\xF000븁\x0000\nAll right!\nI have a strong Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000
That's right.\nThe Pokémon is no longer with me.
...The Pokémon is no longer with me.\xF000븁\x0000\n...That's not true.\nAs long as I remember,\xF000븀\x0000\nit will be with me forever.
If you like, I will make\nyour Pokémon healthy!\xF000븁\x0000\nHowever! Let me challenge you\nto a battle first!\xF000븁\x0000
What? \nDid MY Pokémon lose energy?
Now, as I promised,\nI will make your Pokémon healthy.\xF000븁\x0000
To make people healthy,\nDoctors go where they are needed.
During a long journey,\nyou'll be happy if you meet a Doctor.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you can win against me,\nI'll make your Pokémon healthy!\xF000븁\x0000
Your team is very healthy. Let me\njust fix your team up a little bit...
After a Pokémon battle,\nlet them recover slowly.\xF000븁\x0000
Health is always crucial!\nIt really is.
I've survived a lot of fierce battles\nwith my Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nI don't think I will lose!\xF000븁\x0000
The one who survived\nfierce battles was you?!
My heart is not broken.\xF000븁\x0000\nI will survive further fierce battles\nwith my Pokémon,\xF000븀\x0000\nand I will become much stronger.
Take this!\nThe winning strategy I've developed!\xF000븁\x0000
Sigh...\nI feel down.
I feel down only briefly!\xF000븁\x0000\nI am a Trainer. If I give up,\nmy Pokémon cannot do anything! Right?
I will test you to see whether\nyou have what it takes...\xF000븁\x0000\nto aim for the Pokémon League!\xF000븁\x0000
I see! I see, I see!\nI see, I see, I see, I see!
They say that there is a strong Champion\nin the Pokémon League.\xF000븁\x0000\nSomeday, I will be able to challenge\nthe Pokémon League!
I am an Ace Trainer!\nBasically, I am very strong.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe Unova region will be shaken\nif I lose.\xF000븁\x0000
...The meaning of my existence\nis being threatened right now!
Someday, your existence will shake\nthis Unova region!\xF000븁\x0000\nMy loss looks more impressive\nif I praise you as a hotshot.
Hey! My Pokémon are great.\nLook, look!\xF000븁\x0000
Argh!
I am called an Ace Trainer, but\nthat doesn't sit well with me.\xF000븁\x0000\n'Cause I just love Pokémon,\nand I just want to be strong!
Even at an electrified place like this,\nif somebody challenges me,\xF000븀\x0000\nI will take that challenge.\xF000븀\x0000\nThat is an Ace Trainer!\xF000븁\x0000
Hmmm...\nI am electrified!
Bits of knowledge about electricity!\xF000븁\x0000\nAn electric current runs from plus\nto minus, and an electron runs\xF000븀\x0000\nfrom minus to plus.
I'm really serious about training.\xF000븁\x0000\nI even visit this electrified cave\nto train myself and my Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
The electric shock racing...\nMe falling down...
Some Pokémon like to live\nin this electrified cave...\xF000븁\x0000\nDon't you think that people\nshould stay out?
I've improved my ability\nby fighting strong opponents,\xF000븀\x0000\ncatching them, and overtaking them!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou're strong!\nI'll overtake you at all costs!\xF000븁\x0000
I was far from catching up with you...\nYou are no ordinary person!!
No time to feel down after a defeat!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf moaning over a loss made me strong,\nI would bemoan a loss forever, though.
What pleases sleeping spirits\nis a hot Pokémon battle!\xF000븁\x0000
It's a spark of your flaming spirit!
When I come here... At Celestial Tower,\nstrangely, I feel the urge to fight.\xF000븁\x0000\nDoes that prove I am alive?
I'm here to understand the end\nof the world, but I don't quite get it.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf I have a battle,\nwill I be enlightened...?\xF000븁\x0000
The end...\nIs that it?
People, Pokémon...\nEven if the world is gone,\xF000븀\x0000\nthat is not the end.\xF000븀\x0000\nI feel sure of it.
Indescribable energy\nis flowing to me!\xF000븁\x0000
The energy is escaping...\nAww...
A lot of energies are swirling\naround in the world,\xF000븀\x0000\nincluding hopes and dreams.
...I still want to fight!\nWandering spirits command me!\xF000븁\x0000
Lemme breathe a sec...\nThe spirits have calmed down a bit.
In a way...the Celestial Tower\nis a space full of desires to live.
Watching a practice makes you feel\nthat you are stronger, too,\xF000븀\x0000\ndoesn't it?\xF000븀\x0000\nSo let's have a battle!\xF000븁\x0000
Hawk: ...I could not\ndo it well at all.\xF000븁\x0000\nDar: ...I could not\ndo it right at all.
They can do even the hardest things\nas if they were so simple...\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's the great thing\nabout professionals.
We cannot have\na one-on-two battle.
We were watching various team sports,\nand we wanted to fight as a duo, too!\xF000븁\x0000

Playing as a team is difficult.\xF000븁\x0000\nWe could do more great things\nif we could understand what\xF000븀\x0000\nother people were thinking!
We would like to have\na Pokémon battle as a duo.
I get excited just by\ncoming to this stadium!!\xF000븁\x0000
Joe: I got super excited!\xF000븁\x0000\nRoss: What a thrill!\nIt's taking my breath away!
Just by being here! Just by watching it!\nI get really excited!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf I played a game here,\nI would be extremely excited!
We don't want to have\na one-on-two battle.
If we fight in this stadium,\ndon't you think we will understand\xF000븀\x0000\nhow our star players feel?\xF000븁\x0000

We had a battle with Pokémon\nin the stadium...\xF000븁\x0000\nI am happy 'cause I experienced\nwhat star players feel!
One-on-two? \nWe cannot fight like that.
Watching people practicing\nmakes me want to get moving, too!\xF000븁\x0000\nSoooooo, let's practice\nPokémon battles.\xF000븁\x0000
Masa: I laugh even though\nwe lost because it was fun!\xF000븁\x0000\nYas: Ah! I didn't cheer enough\nfor our Pokémon.
It's way more fun to have a battle\nourselves than watching\xF000븀\x0000\nother people practicing!
We cannot have\na one-on-two battle.
We usually cheer for other people,\nbut today we would like\xF000븀\x0000\nto gather our courage\xF000븀\x0000\nand have our own Pokémon battle.\xF000븁\x0000

I am not good at sports,\nbut I enjoy sports in my own way--\xF000븀\x0000\nby cheering my heart out for people!
You have only one Pokémon\nthat can fight. It's out of the question.
Watching athletes practice with Pokémon\nmade me want to have a Pokémon battle.\xF000븁\x0000
Kay: Great!\nYou are like a professional!\xF000븁\x0000\nAli: How did you know?
Ohhh... I knew it was difficult\nto fight with Pokémon as well as\xF000븀\x0000\nthe professionals do.
We are two!\nWe use two Pokémon, too!
Pokémon do\nwhat I cannot do.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou know how wonderful this is,\ndon't you?\xF000븁\x0000

Even existing sports shine\nwith new appeal\xF000븀\x0000\nwhen they team up with Pokémon!
Aren't you in trouble if you don't have\nmore Pokémon that can fight?
Which do you like better,\ntennis or basketball?\xF000븁\x0000
Ami: The game ended\nbefore I knew what was going on.\xF000븁\x0000\nEira: The combination of you\nand your Pokémon is great!
I love both tennis and basketball!\xF000븁\x0000\nI can't choose just one of them, just\nlike I can't choose my favorite Pokémon.
What? You have only one\nPokémon that can fight?
We are always together!\nOur combination play must be great!\xF000븁\x0000

Be in sync with your partner,\nand with your Pokémon, too.\xF000븀\x0000\nTag Battles are tough!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut if you are in sync,\nit will be very exciting!
You have only one\nhealthy Pokémon...?
Real Fishermen are impatient!\nSo we must battle immediately!\xF000븁\x0000
I lost!\nIt's the end!!
How do I know that real Fishermen\nare so impatient?\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause we change places frantically\nif we cannot catch Pokémon!
Kids! Please cooperate with the\nphysical therapy for me and my Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
My tackle was supposed to crush\neven Rock-type Pokémon...
I was injured in a rough game, so\nI am undergoing some physical therapy.
Join our team!\xF000븁\x0000\nActually, I will force you\nto join our team!\xF000븁\x0000
Our team doesn't need a Trainer\nwho is quite that strong!
We are cooooool!\nWe hang out here every day!
If I win, give me your Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
That was just a joke.\nYou didn't have to take it so seriously!
Bah! I haven't fallen so low\nthat I would steal somebody's Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nlike Team Plasma!
Mua-ha-ha! I will leave here\nfor Victory Road.\xF000븀\x0000\nIt's my hobby to win against Trainers!\xF000븁\x0000
I can't believe this!
Rather than enjoying defeating someone,\nshould I aim higher...?\xF000븁\x0000\nI guess the Pokémon League is the place\nto find a better class of challengers.
Words are unnecessary!\nI can understand everything if we battle.\xF000븁\x0000
...
Though people and Pokémon\ncannot communicate with words,\xF000븀\x0000\nwe can communicate with our hearts!
I trained and trained like a madman,\nand my Pokémon trained even more!\xF000븁\x0000
Yeah! Yeah!\nEven though I lost, I'm energetic!
My Fighting-type Pokémon!\nI train it to smash the challenge rock!
You are strong!\nNo, both you and your Pokémon are strong!
Extreme conditions\nreally test you and train you!
The wonderful combination\nof you and your Pokémon!\xF000븀\x0000\nWhat a beautiful friendship!
The pain of my Pokémon...\nI feel it, too!
No! Not yet!\nNo! We can fight on!!
Aghhhh...\nI did my best, but we lost...
I didn't see that coming.\nYou are a very difficult opponent.
Now is the moment of truth!\nThis really gets my blood pumping!
This intense feeling that floods\nme after a defeat...\xF000븀\x0000\nI don't know how to describe it.
Meow, meow, meow!\xF000븁\x0000\nThis sign means\nhave a battle with me!\xF000븁\x0000
Thank you for having a battle\nwith me!
Meow, meow, meow!\xF000븁\x0000\nI am copying the Pokémon\nI used to live with.
Victory Road!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'll test myself by fighting against you\nto see if I am ready to climb it!\xF000븁\x0000
Agh...\nWas it too early for me?!
Victory Road!\nIt is really amazing!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's the road to\nthe Pokémon League!
I'm a Hiker exploring caves.\nI will teach you the harshness of life\xF000븀\x0000\nand the difficulty of Pokémon battles.\xF000븁\x0000
Well...\nGuess I'll take a hike.
In the caves...\nPokémon lurk in the piles of dirt!
Conquering a mountain means\nconquering your fears!\xF000븁\x0000\nCan you win against Pokémon\nthat have conquered many mountains?\xF000븁\x0000
You conquered a B-list mountain.\nThat B-lister is me!
Hikers aim at summits.\xF000븁\x0000\nPokémon Trainers aim\nfor the Pokémon League!
You need a Nurse's help?\xF000븁\x0000\nSure, if you can win against me,\nI'll make your Pokémon healthy!\xF000븁\x0000
Come on!\nYour team is really healthy!
OK! Then...\nTime to give your Pokémon some energy!\xF000븁\x0000
It's wonderful that each Pokémon and\neach person can do something special!\xF000븁\x0000\nMe, I know how to make Pokémon healthy!
Welcome to the Battle Company!\nSince you are here, battle with me.\xF000븀\x0000\nI won't take no for an answer!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, dear. Aren't you being\ntoo hard on me?
In the Battle Company, the stronger you\nare, the higher the floor you work on.
Hee hee! I am better at Pokémon battles\nthan I am at work!\xF000븁\x0000
I'm good at Pokémon, but I still lost!
A competent woman is\nas good at Pokémon battles\xF000븀\x0000\nas she is at her work!
Clay is at the bottom of the Gym,\nbut I will test you to see\xF000븀\x0000\nwhether you are skilled enough\xF000븀\x0000\nto face the Gym Leader.\xF000븁\x0000
Agh, so frustrating!\nMaybe I'm not skilled enough...
I started Pokémon battles\nafter I grew up,\xF000븀\x0000\nbut I got so into it!
Pouring rain... ♪\nFighting Pokémon... ♪\xF000븁\x0000
Ah, hear the sad melody\nof a total defeat...
Rain is a wonderful melody\nthat nature plays! ♪
Water fun with Pokémon!\nDo you want to play with us?\xF000븁\x0000
Uh-oh... I lost.\nBut it was fun, so I'm satisfied.
Aquatic sports with Pokémon!\nNothing is more fun than that!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's 100% impossible to live\nwithout Pokémon.
The splish-splosh sounds! Those were\nyour footsteps, weren't they?\xF000븀\x0000\nSo cute!\xF000븁\x0000
You are so strong--too strong to be cute!
According to footstep fortune-telling...\xF000븁\x0000\nThose whose footsteps make a splish and\na splosh are Trainers that Pokémon like.
If you turn a parasol around,\nit's like a flower blossoming in the rain!\xF000븁\x0000
Ack...\nCome on!
On rainy days, use a parasol,\nwear a coat, or get wet.\xF000븀\x0000\nDo as you like!
I am a Rich Boy,\nso I have a great Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
I am a Rich Boy. Even though I lost,\nI'm not frustrated! Bah!
I am a Rich Boy. I will go on a shopping\nspree to make myself feel better!
Even when I am resting from\ntoo much shopping, I'm willing to battle!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, no! I'm still the one to beat\nin shopping competitions, though!
I'm very rich, but even I am\npleased with the selection\xF000븀\x0000\nat this shopping mall. I want to buy more!
I will show you how energetic\nI've become just by being here!\xF000븁\x0000
Naaatuuure!
If I use this, will my Pokémon\nalso become energetic?\xF000븁\x0000
When we are surrounded by green,\nwe feel more energetic. Don't you think?\xF000븀\x0000\nThank you, Mother Nature!
We are totally in sync!\xF000븁\x0000\nUsing our amazing connection,\nI will teach you all about Rangers!\xF000븁\x0000
In fact, we learned\nall about you!
Do you know much\nabout this Berry?\xF000븁\x0000
Listen carefully...\xF000븁\x0000\nYou may hear the sound\nof breathing Pokémon and plants.
Mother Nature changes her look\naccording to the seasons...\xF000븀\x0000\nThat's something I cherish!\xF000븁\x0000
OK!\nYou seem to cherish nature!
When seasons change,\nMother Nature gives us this.\xF000븁\x0000
Nature changes,\nand Pokémon evolve...\xF000븁\x0000\nHow can people change?
It takes 20 or even 30 years\nfor a tree to be fully grown!\xF000븁\x0000\nWill you have a Pokémon battle\nthat pleases the trees?\xF000븁\x0000
I did my best...\nI am satisfied!
This is what a tree gave me!\xF000븁\x0000
It's a slow business,\ngrowing a tree.\xF000븁\x0000\nNo need to rush.\nRaise strong Pokémon slowly.
I'll show you our style.\nMy Pokémon and nature are in harmony.\xF000븁\x0000
Wasn't our style worthy?
What do you let your Pokémon have?\nWhat is their style?\xF000븁\x0000
First, we'll create our own style!\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause I am hopeless\nat social niceties and fashions!
It blends in among the trees and grass,\nand it shows its strength.\xF000븀\x0000\nSee the strength of my Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
What I wanted to see\nwas not YOUR strength...
This is what Pokémon love.\nHere, take some!\xF000븁\x0000
There is nature and there are cities,\nand it's lovely to have the choice.\xF000븁\x0000\nBoth people and Pokémon\ncan choose their favorite places!
Hm! You are an interesting case!\nPlease help me with my experiment!\xF000븁\x0000
Hm-hum! It's difficult to get a result\nwith this method.
When the wind blows, seeds fly.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen seeds fly, flowers bloom.\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen the flowers bloom, we'll get seeds.\xF000븁\x0000\nEverything is connected!
Just because I am a Scientist,\npeople think I am so serious!\xF000븁\x0000
Shocking! Nooooo waaaay!\nI loooooost!
To turn a ridiculous idea\ninto a reality...\xF000븁\x0000\nScience can make much more happen\nthan everyone thinks!
Oh! An unfamiliar face!\xF000븁\x0000\nTo help scientific progress,\nplease lend me a hand!\xF000븁\x0000
Instead of lending a hand,\nyou gave me a workout!
I don't know if science will make everyone\nhappy, but if I believe it will, that\xF000븀\x0000\nhelps me do my best. That's a fact.
I want to solve!\xF000븁\x0000\nAll the mysteries!\xF000븁\x0000\nIn the world!\xF000븁\x0000\nFor that purpose! I will keep fighting!\xF000븁\x0000
Whether I win or lose!\nMysteries only deepen!
I don't think I can solve\nall mysteries by myself!\xF000븁\x0000\nHowever! If I can discover something new\nand help someone, I will be satisfied!
I've found a wonderful Trainer!\nI will research you immediately!\xF000븁\x0000
The results of my research have revealed\nthat you are the best!
It is very exciting\nto unlock the secrets\xF000븀\x0000\nof Pokémon and their Trainers.
I love this place! The electricity\ncharges up my inspiration!\xF000븁\x0000
Aha!  \nThat made a light bulb go on in my head!
When a person moves,\nelectric signals travel in the body!\xF000븁\x0000\nAlso, when a person has an inspiration,\nelectric signals travel to the brain!
Pokémon and Poké Balls\nare my real friends!\xF000븁\x0000\nJoin the training of\nour Pokémon Eleven!\xF000븁\x0000
Aghhhhh! I must still be green!\nI have plenty of guts, though!
Both my Pokémon and I\nstill haven't gotten enough practice...\xF000븀\x0000\nIn terms of levels, that would be five...
I am about to give a lecture\non the strength created by gathering\xF000븀\x0000\na proper balance of different Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
Bam! You lectured me!\nWhat a great Trainer!
Team play with Pokémon\nbrought new fun to our sport.
My dad is working in a Gym!\nI am receiving special training there!\xF000븁\x0000
...Dad.\n...I couldn't win.
I have Pokémon battles with my dad, too.\nMy dad and I are quite evenly matched!
Workers carry Pokémon and loads.\nI am a Youngster.\xF000븁\x0000\nI am close to my Pokémon,\nand we all cooperate happily!\xF000븁\x0000
Ummmm! You're closer\nto your Pokémon than I am!
It never occurred to you that\nthe Pokémon you find around containers\xF000븀\x0000\ncame here from another place?
Sometimes you find more than just strong\nPokémon in the tall grass!\xF000븁\x0000
Strooooong!\nWhat a Trainer!!
I will grow better and better\nby fighting Pokémon in the tall grass!
Oh!\xF000븁\x0000\nOhhh?\xF000븁\x0000\nWhat?! That's not a Pokémon,\njust an ordinary Trainer!\xF000븁\x0000
You are not an ordinary Trainer.\nYou are a strong Trainer!!
Have you heard that when tall grass\nwaves in the breeze,\xF000븀\x0000\na rare Pokémon jumps out?
These are special Pokémon\nI just caught!\xF000븁\x0000
I just caught them\nand have not raised them yet!
OK! I will catch some different Pokémon\nin Pinwheel Forest and have more friends!
OK! I'm brave and I'm bold!\nLet's get right to the battle!\xF000븁\x0000
Pfft...\nMy bold bravery is vanishing into the air...
I will tell you 'cause you're strong!\xF000븁\x0000\nOnly one piece of the challenge rock\nwill be chipped off each day!
I wanted to captivate you,\nbut I feel like I slipped and fell!
I've seen a lot of Trainers!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou seem to have the same aura\nthat I felt from strong Trainers.\xF000븁\x0000
Exactly!\nYour aura is exactly what I felt!
You have abundant kindness\nas well as strength.
I'm the best around here.\nCan you possibly be a match for me?\xF000븁\x0000
Your talent and sense...\nBoth are dazzling.
Perhaps the secret of your strength\nis your commitment.
I am a Waiter who is good\nat Pokémon battles.\xF000븁\x0000
Wonderful battle! A learning experience.\n...Thanks for the tip!
Our specialty is the best\nPokémon battles.
Welcome!\xF000븁\x0000\nWould you like a cold drink\nwith your Pokémon battle?\xF000븁\x0000
That was a wonderful battle.\nBravo!
Invigorating Soda Pop for exhausted\nPokémon after a battle!\xF000븀\x0000\nAvailable in any vending machine!
Twist Mountain changes in every season,\nand this old man changes in every battle!\xF000븁\x0000
Go easy on...\na grown-up?!
This old man likes winter.\xF000븁\x0000\nSnow on Twist Mountain...\nhas an indescribable beauty.
My Pokémon love the ore mined here,\nand they love fiery Pokémon battles!\xF000븁\x0000
You got me!\nMy Pokémon thinks so, too!
If Pokémon eat the ore inside a mountain,\na hole grows, and our work speeds up!\xF000븁\x0000\nPeople and Pokémon\nwork great together!
The number two Trainer\non Twist Mountain is me!\xF000븁\x0000
From now on, you are the number two Trainer\non Twist Mountain.
From now on, I will be the\nnumber three Trainer on Twist Mountain.\xF000븁\x0000\nFor your information,\nthe number one is Clay!
What do you think about the cannons?\xF000븁\x0000\nIsn't it great that you can\nexperience how flying Pokémon feel?\xF000븁\x0000\nNext, experience the feeling\nof losing a Pokémon battle!\xF000븁\x0000
I was blown away!!
I'll be stronger if I fight\nwhile thinking about Pokémon!\xF000븀\x0000\nVictory will come my way!
Trainer! I bet you're\ntoo blown away to fight!\xF000븁\x0000
What a calm person you are!\nYou're amazing!
Cannons used once may be used again.\nIt's recycling! Precisely!
In order to jump higher,\nI am practicing really hard!\xF000븁\x0000
No problem! Even though I lost,\nI will just prepare and jump again!
Trainer! Do you remember\nwhat you were told at the beginning?\xF000븁\x0000\n“The cannons go up, down,\nleft, and right.\xF000븀\x0000\nYou can enter them from anywhere!"\xF000븁\x0000\nHow about that?\nI am good at imitating him, aren't I?
My plans are perfectly honed!\nI cannot lose!\xF000븁\x0000
No way! What part of my fighting style\ndid I forget to double-check?
Check after check after check!\nComplacency leads to accidents!
Battles in the Castelia Gym are\nbeautiful! They are pure art!!\xF000븁\x0000
Falling beautifully...\nThis is also an art...
If you step on two switches, two lamps\nwill light up and a gate will open!\xF000븀\x0000\nThis is also an art!
I like the feeling of walking\nthrough the honey walls...\xF000븀\x0000\nI've walked through them many times.\xF000븁\x0000
How is this possible?\nI will walk through the honey walls again.
The honey walls...\nWhat do you think they are made of?\xF000븁\x0000\nDon't you think it is odd\nthat Burgh never tells us?
What do you think? This Pokémon Gym...\nHow should I say? Isn't it full of...\xF000븀\x0000\noutrageous and mysterious charms?\xF000븁\x0000
As a Trainer,\nyou are full of charm!
I absolutely love this Gym where\nBurgh's vision became reality!
I wasn't hiding under the floor\njust to lose!
I was defeated by your strong spirit.\nYou seem unfazed by anything!
OK, challenger!\nBring it on!\xF000븁\x0000
But then, but...\nI lost?!
Get on the elevators,\nand go down and down!\xF000븁\x0000\nA Trainer's spirit means\ntake it as far as you can!
When the elevator goes up,\nmy spirits rise!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen the elevator goes down,\nmy spirits fall...\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you want to know why Clay\nis at the bottom, defeat me!\xF000븁\x0000
I lost. There go my spirits...\naaaaaall the way down!
Clay is waiting\nat the very bottom because...\xF000븁\x0000\nhe wants to remember\nthat he was at the bottom in the past.
I face my Pokémon,\nand we share our real feelings.\xF000븁\x0000\nSometimes that's what I do\nin this Pokémon Gym.\xF000븁\x0000
Right now, my Pokémon and I\nboth feel the sting of defeat!
When we lose,\nI apologize to my Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000\nIt is important for our future,\nand it helps me grow strong!
Wow! You are so strong!\nCongratulations!
Here's my lame excuse:\nI lost because the ship was swaying!






I thought I could take it easy against you,\nbut got burned bad!
While I was staring at your pretty face,\nthe Pokémon battle was over.
You know so many rare Pokémon!\nOr at least, your Pokémon are new to me.
I... I am not disappointed.\nBecause I am elegant!
Dizzy...\nSo very dizzzzzy...
Having traveled the world, I realized\nwe can communicate through our Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000
That message came through loud and clear!
Having traveled around the world,\nI learned that travel brings change!\xF000븁\x0000\nWe should not be afraid of change.
Countless feelings infuse these ruins!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's fun to imagine them!\nAnd how are you feeling?\xF000븁\x0000
I am feeling...\nvery upset because I could not win!
People and Pokémon\neach have different feelings.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd probably both are correct.
Being with my Pokémon makes me happy\neven when we’re in a bad situation!\xF000븁\x0000
Yes! It was fun that your and my Pokémon\nwere both so energetic!
When I feel lonely at night,\nI curl up with my Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nand watch the twinkling stars.\xF000븁\x0000\nI track the shooting stars\nand slow down the rhythm of my life.
Whether I travel or not,\nI want to make a great discovery.\xF000븁\x0000
Oh! I may have discovered\nsomething good about you!
The world is full of mysteries!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's why I look closely.\nThat's why I listen carefully.\xF000븁\x0000\nI think, I reflect, and\nI discover something new.
The Abilities of my Pokémon!\nI will show them to you.\xF000븁\x0000
I could not make really good use\nof the Ability Mummy...
If an Ability is changed to Mummy,\nthe Pokémon cannot use its original\xF000븀\x0000\nAbility. It's subtly devious, isn't it?
Oh! That moment!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's when we use Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000
Oh! Is it over already?
Oh! That moment.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's when you notice\nhow great Pokémon are!
I am a Psychic, so just one look at you\ntells me that you are a Trainer!\xF000븁\x0000
I am a Psychic,\nso I can tell the battle is over.
Sifting the ever-changing sands...\nSifting my ever-changing feelings...\xF000븁\x0000\nTelepathy means others will be aware of\nmy feelings. That could be a good thing.\xF000븁\x0000\nWait! It means others will be aware when\nI have awkward or painful feelings, too!
Let me battle with you!\xF000븁\x0000
Wow...\nYou are my strongest challenger so far.
Engage the switches and\nstart from the defined position.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you try all the combinations,\nsomeday you'll find the right one!
The problem is never\nwhether you can battle or not.\xF000븀\x0000\nIt's whether you will battle or not.\xF000븁\x0000
If you don't fight, you won't lose,\nbut you won't grow stronger, either.
When you're not sure if you'll succeed,\nbuild momentum and take a leap!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's fine! Because your Pokémon\nare always with you!
The slippery frozen floor is perfect\nfor improving your sense of balance!\xF000븁\x0000
I slipped and lost!
Brycen slides on the frozen floor\nall the time, so it's worn down, and\xF000븀\x0000\nit looks like you can see the path...\xF000븀\x0000\nbut maybe I'm imagining it.
Well, well, if you are feeling dizzy\nbecause of the Gym machines,\xF000븀\x0000\nI will stand in your path!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, dear me!
Being fired into the air by cannons\nand spinning on the ice many times...\xF000븀\x0000\nIt's difficult to get Badges.
I always calm myself and choose\nthe critical moment in a battle.\xF000븁\x0000
Mmmm?! What?!\nNo way? Really?!
Being calm and having no emotion\nare different.\xF000븁\x0000\nBrycen rejoices quietly,\nand he grows quietly in rage...
I am the King of Karate!!\xF000븁\x0000\nI've taught my Pokémon moves\nthat they'll use in battle with you!\xF000븁\x0000
I am the King of Karate!!\nI am skillful, but I lose quite often...
I am from a fighting dojo in Kanto!!\nThis is my global debut, so to speak!
Oh! Trainer!\nDo you want to learn a bitter lesson?\xF000븁\x0000
The training is over!
Going slowly is fine.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf I train every single day,\nI will be strong someday!
Are you looking for a Pokémon here,\nor are you just taking a walk?\xF000븀\x0000\nEither way, have a battle with me!\xF000븁\x0000
What is it?\nI can't explain it, but you are great!
Even if you forget about this battle,\nI will never forget this!
Competitive eating\nis one thing I'm good at!\xF000븁\x0000
What I am bad at\nis Pokémon battles...
I am training here to improve my\nweak points.
Beginnings are important, whether\nin a good novel or a good battle!
It seems this is the beginning\nof my final chapter.
I feel we're about to turn the page\nto the epilogue of this story.
Wow. I'm dumbstruck!\xF000븁\x0000\nI know a lot of words, but right now I can't\nfigure out how to say this.\xF000븁\x0000\nPerhaps, if the feeling I'm having now\nis put into words, it will be trapped there.\xF000븁\x0000\nSo let me say this...\nMy feeling is you're a great Trainer!
I never thought you would use that move...\nNot a bad choice at all.
Good, good...\nBut I will never retreat from any battle.
Even in this situation,\nthere must be a way to triumph!
If somebody wins a battle, then, without\ndoubt, someone else has lost the battle.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's the way of battle.\xF000븁\x0000\nA real warrior doesn't dash off in pursuit\nof the next victory, nor throw a fit\xF000븀\x0000\nwhen experiencing a loss.\xF000븁\x0000\nA real warrior ponders the next battle.
Oh, so strong.\nThat makes my heart dance!
That's my final Pokémon!\nSo we'll use our last bit of strength!
Well, this may be the last.\nI will put everything into my next move!
There is no single strongest Pokémon\nor sole best combination...\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's why it is difficult\nto keep winning.\xF000븁\x0000\nHowever, I think a heart that desires\nstrength and strives to grow\xF000븀\x0000\nstronger is a precious ideal.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat is why I respect you--\nbecause you have these things.
I get the feeling a wonderful time\nis about to start. I'm excited!
Even at a time like this,\nI should stay cool and collected...
For the sake of the Pokémon\nthat believe in me, I will never give up.
As a Trainer, you are both excellent\nand elegant. Your Pokémon have class.\xF000븁\x0000\nI am very pleased to have battled you.
Do you believe that Pokémon battles\nhelp us understand one another?
I will show you that my love for my friends\npermeates every cell of my body. Behold!
My friends getting hurt...\nThat's what a Pokémon battle is.
Agggghh.\nEvery single time...
It's not fun to see\nmy friends in trouble.
Well, that's OK.\nI was expecting this defeat.
Do you really think you can stop us\nwith that?
My last friend...\nPlease share your courage with me!
Is the world going to choose you--\nand not me?!
Everything’s ruined. The truth I held...\nThe dreams Pokémon shared...
I was expecting exactly that kind of move!
What is going on here?
My calculations... No! My careful schemes!\nThe world should be mine!
I am a Doctor!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you have Pokémon in bad shape...\nLet me see your Pokémon in battle!\xF000븁\x0000
Your strength is fathomless!\nI am deeply impressed.
Whether your Pokémon are healthy\nor not, I'll restore them to full health!\xF000븁\x0000
I aim to be the best Doctor in the world!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut first, I intend to become\nthe best Trainer in the world!
An Ace Trainer like me has pride,\nso I won't lose!\xF000븁\x0000
I could not protect my pride.\nI'm mortified!
Pride does not mean acting arrogantly!\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm really proud of what\nI have achieved in my life!
I've thought about what I can do\nto help my Pokémon win, and\xF000븀\x0000\nfinally I figured out the answer!\xF000븁\x0000
I'm afraid I could not read\nwhat you wanted to do...
Read what your opponent wants to do.\xF000븁\x0000\nYour opponent is human and may change\nplans from moment to moment. Be careful!
Before going to the Pokémon League,\nlet me test my skills!\xF000븁\x0000
It's obvious, but there is always\nsomeone better...
The Elite Four are said to be\nwaiting at the Pokémon League.\xF000븀\x0000\nI wonder what kind of people they are.
Oh, boy...\nMy Pokémon want to brag about me.\xF000븁\x0000\nSo, let's start!\xF000븁\x0000
Ouch!\nThey can't brag about me.
Because I respect my opponents,\nI want to win against them!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's why I want other people to think\nthey want to win against me!
Whenever I am lost, I meet a Trainer!\nOf course, we're gonna fight!\xF000븁\x0000
Mmmmm... It's not good\nto fight when I am lost.
When people move ahead,\nthey get lost, or they stop...\xF000븁\x0000\nAt those moments, Pokémon give you\ncourage to keep moving forward!
The people who pass by here\nhave such different moods!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's fun to watch, and even more fun\nto fight against them!\xF000븁\x0000
Mwa haha!\nIt's fun!
Winning is good,\nbut winning is not everything...\xF000븀\x0000\nDon't lose sight of what's important!
Wait! \nYou, young Trainer over there!\xF000븁\x0000\nLook at my Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000
Not bad!\nI like your strength.
As a Pokémon grows, its connection\nto its Trainer will improve,\xF000븀\x0000\nand their bond becomes stronger!
If there is a steep cave in the east,\nI go there and train my Pokémon, and\xF000븀\x0000\nif there is a strong Trainer in the west,\xF000븀\x0000\nI go there and challenge that Trainer!\xF000븁\x0000
My Pokémon clearly lack\nproper training!!
Pokémon training Pokémon...\xF000븁\x0000\nIf they live in rugged wilderness,\nthat can happen naturally.
Oh, are you the legendary Pokémon\nthat is said to live here?\xF000븁\x0000
You startled me.\nYou are a person!
In the story I know,\nthe legendary Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nwas training its student Pokémon.
These Pokémon were born\non the same day and raised together!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh!\nYou're pretty good!
Our days with Pokémon\nare full of happiness, and\xF000븀\x0000\nour joys will grow as we live together!
Please tell me what kinds of Pokémon are\nby your side and share your happiness\xF000븀\x0000\nwhen you are happy!\xF000븁\x0000
Wow!\nWonderful!
When I've been happy or sad,\nthe Pokémon have always been with me.\xF000븁\x0000\nI hope I can stay with them\nas long as possible.
Celestial Tower means a perfect tower!\xF000븁\x0000\nOh, never mind.\nLet's have a Pokémon battle.\xF000븁\x0000
You're really perfect!
I am far from perfect...
Pokémon that grew up in Unova and\nPokémon that grew up elsewhere--\xF000븀\x0000\nboth rest here quietly.\xF000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon are full of life!
Pokémon that grew up in Unova and\nPokémon that grew up elsewhere--\xF000븀\x0000\nall are precious Pokémon...
I will guess what you are...\xF000븁\x0000\nYou are...\na Pokémon Trainer!\xF000븁\x0000
What was that?\nI guessed what you were, though.
Everyone can make the effort\nto understand their opponent.
The Dragon Gym in Opelucid City\nis where tough Trainers show\xF000븀\x0000\nthey can carve out their own path!\xF000븁\x0000
I'm sure you can carve out\nyour own path!
As the name suggests,\na Gym Leader is the top of a Gym!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe Leader is top of the heap\nat this Opelucid Gym!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you want to meet the Leader,\nclimb up on the dragons' backs\xF000븀\x0000\nand aim for the top floor!
Do you understand\nhow the dragons' heads move?\xF000븁\x0000
You're strong! I guess you want to know\nabout the dragons' heads pretty badly.
The dragons' arms go up and down...\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd depending on the arms,\nthe dragons' heads turn right and left\xF000븀\x0000\nand move up and down, too.\xF000븁\x0000\nListen! Here is a hint!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf both arms point down,\nthe dragon's head sinks down, too.
I will test you to see how well\nyou really know Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
You are bringing out your Pokémon's\nfull potential!
I am a Trainer. \nI don't have to get strong myself.\xF000븁\x0000\nAll I have to do is to support Pokémon\nso that they can fight at their best.
By any chance,\nare you unsure of what to do?\xF000븁\x0000
What is this?\nI felt your confidence.
The dragons in this Gym\ncan be elevators, too!
I will tell a Trainer who beats me\nhow to move forward in this Gym!\xF000븁\x0000
Wow! \nYou beat me!
Jump from a triangle mark!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen you land on a switch on an arm,\nthe dragon's head will move,\xF000븀\x0000\nand you can move ahead!
Are you happy just hanging out\nwith Pokémon?\xF000븀\x0000\nOr do they have to be strong?\xF000븀\x0000\nWe'll see which type you are!\xF000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon seem to be happy\njust hanging around with you!
Every person loves Pokémon\nin a different way.\xF000븁\x0000\nGetting strong with my Pokémon...\nThat's the way I chose.
I wonder what you will do\nas a Trainer?!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, you fight very well.\nYou are great!
I love Pokémon battles!\xF000븁\x0000\nI never know what my opponent will do.\nIt gives me chills!\xF000븁\x0000\nWin or lose, it's the excitement\nof the fight that counts!
My favorite word is “challenge"!\nDo you like challenges?\xF000븁\x0000
You seem to like challenges!
Do you like challenges...?\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you take a challenge,\nyou can find something good.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you don't try anything, you just\nmake excuses.
Argh...\nMy heart aches!
We have ten years' experience battling!\nI give you a taste of a Veteran's skill!\xF000븁\x0000
I guess the time spent\nis not everything!
Getting stronger...\xF000븁\x0000\nis like walking down a road\nthat never ends,\xF000븀\x0000\nno matter how much you fight...\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's what this Dragon Gym is about.\nIt's the secret of the dragons' backs...
I've heard about you.\nI heard you work Pokémon hard!\xF000븁\x0000
Yes, I heard you are strong.\nYou match what I heard exactly.
To get to a lower level, stand still\nin the midst of quicksand.\xF000븁\x0000\nI'm not being kind...\nMy companions will defeat you.
You!\nTo please my Pokémon, lose!\xF000븁\x0000
What a Trainer!
Because of you,\nmy Pokémon lost!\xF000븀\x0000\nDon't you feel sorry for them?\xF000븁\x0000\nBesides, you are just depending\non your Pokémon for strength.
If everyone frees their Pokémon,\nthere is no winning or losing!\xF000븁\x0000
If I don't have Pokémon,\nI won't lose like this!
How dare you interrupt us\nwithout understanding us?
We fight for the young king...\nThat's it!\xF000븁\x0000
My king...\nI am so sorry.
Everything changes.\nUnova will also be born again.\xF000븀\x0000\nWhy don't you admit that?
You can't change the world\nwithout a little pain!\xF000븁\x0000
Ouch...\nI don't like pain.
We're trying so hard to change the world\nbecause nobody else is trying. Yet...\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's right! You! Can you understand\nour lord N's feelings?
Pokémon are too good for the likes of\nyou! They are amazing, but putting them\xF000븀\x0000\nin the hands of foolish Trainers can bring\xF000븀\x0000\nnothing good!\xF000븁\x0000
Argh!\nAnnoying!
Me, lose? Here I am, covered in sand,\nthrowing everything I have into it,\xF000븀\x0000\nand I lose? Am I that much of a loser?\xF000븁\x0000\nIt should be your loss.\nAnd that's an order!
I won't tolerate people\nwho have different ideas!\xF000븁\x0000
Argh...\nI won't forgive you!
I repeat! We won't tolerate people\nwho have different ideas!\xF000븁\x0000\nYour friends are waiting below--\nnow get out!
When I am surrounded by rocks,\nmy spirit goes up!!\xF000븁\x0000
When I lose,\nmy spirits sink...
My spirits rise and fall.\nI'm just charmingly unpredictable!
Why do I dig?\nWhy do you fight?\xF000븀\x0000\nLet's find out.\xF000븁\x0000
Your past experience...\nIs that the source of your strength?
The more you fight,  \nthe stronger you'll be.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe more you dig, \nthe bigger the hole will be...\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you have a purpose, \nthere's no wasted effort!
At work, we do our best.\nThat is my, and my Pokémon's, way of life!\xF000븁\x0000
We did our best,\nand this is the result?!
Well, well, I guess I'll go back to work.\xF000븁\x0000\n'Cause my precious Pokémon\nare better at work.
My favorite things are:\nMountains! Meals! Pokémon!\xF000븀\x0000\nAnd fun battles!!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, ho ho!\nYou got me!
Your team is so strong!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut my Pokémon were also\nquite good, weren't they?
I'm chasing my dream,\nand I'm fighting for a victory!\xF000븁\x0000
I can't catch that dream!
I am looking for a legendary Pokémon\nsaid to be hiding in this cave.\xF000븁\x0000\nYes, it's true. Men are suckers for\nadventure, no matter how old we get!
This cave is full of rocks\ngenerating electricity!\xF000븀\x0000\nThe electricity is charging me up!\xF000븁\x0000
Yowch, a lightning spark!
The sources of my energy are\nmy precious Pokémon!\xF000븀\x0000\nThis has been scientifically proven!!
I will research and investigate\nyour Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
I must analyze my defeat...
Why don't you go discover\nsomething else?
I will unlock the mechanism\nand find the secret of your power!\xF000븁\x0000
I was so preoccupied with the mechanism,\nI forgot to concentrate on the battle!
The mechanism of rain, and\nthe science of changing seasons...\xF000븀\x0000\nNature is full of wonders.
I see.\nI'm surprised you chose that move.
Mind you...\nIt's not over yet!
Well! You are strong, as usual!
I see.\nI'm surprised you chose that move.
Mind you...\nIt's not over yet!
Well! You are strong, as usual!
I see.\nI'm surprised you chose that move.
Mind you...\nIt's not over yet!
Well! You are strong, as usual!
Plasmaaaa!\nWahhhhh!
Long live Team Plasma!
For every great plan, there\nis someone to get in the way.
Have you learned your lesson now?\n...I'm such a sore loser.
Plasmaaaa!\nAhh, our beautiful dream...
Plasmaaaa!\nThis is a nightmare!
Whoa, whoa, come on now!\nI'm shocked to lose against a little kid!
It's best to use what you have learned\nin order to master it!\xF000븁\x0000
What can you learn by losing?\nI feel like there's a “Eureka!" here for me.
I'm mastering the lesson in three\ndimensions by experiencing it like this!
Come on! \nYou're just a kid--a kid on an ego trip!
Our rules and your rules\nare different!
Plasmaaaa! If this keeps up,\nwe won't save the Pokémon!
My hunch is you're sabotaging us because\nyou're flat-out jealous of our cool outfits.
You seem to understand the importance\nof the first attack very well.
If I can bring out the power of my Pokémon,\nI can still pull this off and win.
Impressive.\nBut why can't I win?!
You seem to understand the importance\nof the first attack very well.

You seem to understand the importance\nof the first attack very well.
If I can bring out the power of my Pokémon,\nI can still pull this off and win.
Impressive.\nBut why can't I win?!
Well, at a time like this,\nlet's have a Pokémon battle!\xF000븁\x0000
I see. \nWas that your favorite Pokémon?
Wherever I go in the world,\nI have Pokémon battles!\xF000븁\x0000\nOnce I ask about someone's favorite\nPokémon, we soon become friends!
My way of life is dynamic!\xF000븁\x0000
My way of losing is\nalso dynamic!
My Pokémon are always with me!\nThat's why I can be dynamic!

...What?
Pah, is that it?\nI lost before I knew it...
Oh, hee hee hee...\nYou're so strong.
Pant, pant, pant, pant...



The ideal movement of living things,\nsuch pure beauty!\xF000븁\x0000\nAh, let me behold them!\xF000븁\x0000
I saw their beauty up close!
You know, creatures that exert \nall their strength are always beautiful.
If you win against me,\nI will give you something good\xF000븀\x0000\nfrom this backpack!\xF000븁\x0000
You are great!\nAnd strong!
Here you are.\nI will give you this as I promised!\xF000븁\x0000
It feels great to run as fast as you can\nover mountains and through forests.\xF000븀\x0000\nRight?
I came here on my journey,\nbut it's kind of lively here, isn't it?\xF000븁\x0000
Is there a festival or something \ngoing on here?
This is what I found during my trip.\nI don't need it, so I will give it to you.\xF000븁\x0000
Everybody is dressed the same way.\nIs this some kind of ceremony?
I bet athletes are not satisfied\nwith their games.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's how I feel\nwhen I watch them.\xF000븁\x0000\nThe reason? If you win against me,\nI will tell you why!\xF000븁\x0000
Are you pleased with your victory?\nOr are you unsatisfied?
This Moomoo Milk is tasty\nand so very satisfying!\xF000븁\x0000
No matter how great their play is,\nthere is always a greater play.\xF000븁\x0000\nI am never satisfied with my bread,\neven though I bake it very well.\xF000븁\x0000\nI always want to make the next\nloaf even more delicious!
A place where you can warm up!\nThat's what I heard and why I came here!\xF000븀\x0000\nLet's turn up the heat on this thing!\xF000븁\x0000
The heat here is too much.\nI'm just burning up!
My warrior's heart is burning!\nThank you for the hot battle!\xF000븁\x0000\nNext, I will stay on this hot streak\nand watch the game!
To raise healthy Pokémon, you need\nto keep their minds and bodies active,\xF000븀\x0000\nwatching games and having battles!\xF000븁\x0000
It's so frustrating to lose!\nBut it's also important to learn from it.
You learn more when you lose\nthan when you win!\xF000븀\x0000\nI think it's the same for sports, too.
The Pokémon I raised are\nas good as professionals!\xF000븁\x0000
The Pokémon you raised\nare great, too!
There are so many ways\nto raise Pokémon.
I am not skipping work!\xF000븁\x0000
If I had known this would happen,\nI would have worked diligently.
Taking a productive break\nis also part of any job!
Someone sent me a ticket, so I came.\nBut there's no game going on!\xF000븁\x0000
I have a lot of work to do.\nWhat am I doing here?
Athletes on off days are no better\nthan guys on days off.
I wonder if there are great children\nwho will become stars someday\xF000븀\x0000\nwho are now just kids at my preschool.\xF000븁\x0000
You are also quite brilliant, but\nreal stars are cool.
You seem to have potential as a star.\nSo, will you please be my friend?\xF000븁\x0000
Should I get autographs now\nfrom children who are likely to be stars?
I love sports and Pokémon most of all.\xF000븁\x0000\nHow about a battle?\nThey used to call me the Cleaner!\xF000븁\x0000
I could not stop all\nof your Pokémon's attacks...
I used to be a Striker.\nI was responsible for scoring goals.\xF000븁\x0000\nNow I am a sweeper.\nI am responsible for sweeping floors.
The athletes' Pokémon are great!\xF000븁\x0000\nBut my Pokémon are also great!\xF000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon are also great!
I will strive to raise my Pokémon\nto that level!
Did you see today's game?!\xF000븁\x0000\nThere was some great ball handling\nby players and Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe excitement is pumping me up\nfor a battle!\xF000븁\x0000
I lost, but I am still excited!
The only place you can watch Pokémon\nenjoying sports is Nimbasa City!
When I come here, I get hyper!\nSo, let's have a battle right away!\xF000븁\x0000
I lost against you too quickly!
When I am watching a game, I get hyper!\nI just can't sit still!
Doctor! Is there a Doctor\nin the audience?\xF000븁\x0000\nYes, I am a Doctor.\nLet's get into a battle.\xF000븁\x0000
Oh! My Pokémon is all worn out!
When Pokémon lose energy, Max Revive!\nYou should also take one with you.\xF000븁\x0000
When I am watching a game,\nI just keep worrying about\xF000븀\x0000\nwhether an athlete will be injured.
You chose to speak to me from\namong so many people!\xF000븀\x0000\nYou have a good eye!\xF000븁\x0000
You are a worthy opponent!
The way you use moves...\nQuite honestly, I like it!\xF000븁\x0000\nHere, this is for you!\xF000븁\x0000
Heehee.\xF000븁\x0000\nEven when I am in the crowd,\npeople can tell I am strong.
I usually act like an Ace Trainer,\nbut I want to be an ordinary girl,\xF000븀\x0000\nat least when I am here.\xF000븁\x0000
I don't want to think about Pokémon\nvery much right now!
If I give you this,\nwill you leave me alone?\xF000븁\x0000
Even as an Ace Trainer, sometimes\nI just want to be an ordinary girl!\xF000븁\x0000\nI want to scream for the cool athletes,\nand enjoy my time.
Which team will score next?!\nIf you can win, I will tell you!\xF000븁\x0000
Aha!\nThat team will score next!
My psychic power only works\nright before a player scores a point.
Heheh...\xF000븁\x0000\nThe team I want to win\nalways wins!\xF000븁\x0000
What...? Was everything up till now\njust a coincidence...?
Feelings matter when you cheer!\nIf I believe, I feel my team will win!
Fishing is a perfectly respectable sport!\nWhy isn't there a fishing stadium?!\xF000븁\x0000
...Of course, fishing is fun\nwhen you enjoy it in nature.\xF000븁\x0000
I like quiet nature,\nbut I like lively places like this, too.
A lot of sports started\nas Gentlemen's games!\xF000븁\x0000
Ladies and Gentlemen!\nThe game is over!
Because I am a Gentleman,\nI will present you with this gift.\xF000븁\x0000
Pokémon battles were born spontaneously\nwhen people and Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nfirst became friendly.
Hey, hey, did you see that? Awesome!\nA lot of famous people from TV are here!\xF000븁\x0000
Athletes are all coooool.\nI want to be like them.
Aghhhhh. Why didn't I bring a camera,\nor a notebook for an autograph?
Sports and juggling are the same.\nYou must entertain the audience!\xF000븀\x0000\nI will show you the fruits of my practice.\xF000븁\x0000
While I am having a Pokémon battle,\nI catch ten balls!
I have mastered the technique,\nbut I cannot use it!\xF000븀\x0000\nI just have to have real battles!
That incredibly flashy dorm,\nand squealing cheerleaders all around...\xF000븁\x0000\nGrrr...\nI am envious!\xF000븁\x0000
What is so great about popular athletes?\nWhat is bad about martial artists?
A run-down dojo, and a lot of shouts like\nhai-ya and kee-up...\xF000븁\x0000\nIf I had known this before, I would have\nbeen a different kind of athlete.
When I grow up,\nI will be a pro athlete!\xF000븁\x0000
Waaaaah!\nI will never give you my autograph!
I will practice my autograph\nfor when I go pro!
My daddy is\nan athlete here!\xF000븁\x0000
Waaaaaah. Dadddddddy.
...I won't cry.\n'Cause I promised my daddy.
Even Socialites enjoy sports,\nin a very elegant way!\xF000븁\x0000\nA Pokémon battle is\na sport in a way!\xF000븀\x0000\nLet's fight elegantly!\xF000븁\x0000
O-ho-ho!\nI lost so elegantly.
Oh dear, I mistook this for a ball\nand ordered it. Now it's yours.\xF000븁\x0000
First of all, we should enjoy\nsports and Pokémon battles!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you get hung up on winning and losing,\nyou lose sight of what is most valuable.
I will be strong in Pokémon battles,\nand I will marry a professional athlete!\xF000븁\x0000
Ah.\nI still have a long way to go!
Your Pokémon are strong. I will give\nsomething good to a strong person!\xF000븁\x0000
Strong people are always totally\nattractive. Don't you think?
A Hiker, an athlete,\nand a Pokémon Trainer.\xF000븀\x0000\nDo you know what is important?\xF000븁\x0000
Grrrrrrr!\nClearly you know it!
Prepare thoroughly. \nIf you don't, you can't do anything!
I can't believe nobody has noticed me...\nI am a star!\xF000븁\x0000
Don't look at me. I lost!
Whose autograph do you want?\nDon't you want one of mine?
You are energetic!\nI will punish lazy children!\xF000븁\x0000
You just don't quit!\nYou are so energetic!
OK! An energetic Trainer!\nTake this!\xF000븁\x0000
Nurses need plenty of stamina,\nboth day and night!
My darling is working here.\nHow about that? Are you envious?\xF000븁\x0000
My darling is seriously the best.\nHe puts athletes to shame.
My darling is a Janitor!\nHe cleans this entire big place\xF000븀\x0000\nby himself every day. Cool, huh?\xF000븀\x0000\nNobody else can do what he does.
Games in the rain look extra tough,\ndon't they?\xF000븁\x0000\nI wonder what Pokémon battles\nin rain are like.\xF000븁\x0000
Well, this place is indoors,\nso they don't get rained out.
If a stadium has a roof, \nthey can play a game anytime!
Hey! It's me! It's me!\nI am the best Pilot in Unova!\xF000븁\x0000
You! You are daring!\nBe my apprentice!
A once-in-a-lifetime flight!\nFly, fly, and fly away!
Do you want to know\nhow the VIP seats are?\xF000븁\x0000\nI will tell you\nif you win against me!\xF000븁\x0000
VIP seats are very far away\nfrom the athletes!
I could see the game fine, but\nthe athletes looked like grains of rice.
You!\nYou are a fan of that person.\xF000븁\x0000\nI can tell!\nBut that person is mine!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh no, oh why?\nI am sorry...
Come to think of it,\nthe more supporters there are,\xF000븀\x0000\nthe better.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou! Cheer until you lose your voice,\nand clap until your hands fall off!
When I am watching a game,\nI feel like I should be moving, too!\xF000븁\x0000
That was a good workout!
The dorm is fine, but I want to play\nsports outdoors.
I want to drag people here\nand have them enlist as Pokémon Rangers.\xF000븁\x0000
Wow! Electrifying!\nYou are so goooood!
You! Be a Pokémon Ranger!\nI will give you a good workout!
Watch a game during a study break!\nHave a battle during a game break!\xF000븁\x0000
Gah!\nThis is so not relaxing!
When I come here for fun,\nI can study more efficiently!
OK, I decided!\nIf I win against you,\xF000븀\x0000\nI will be a Gym Leader!\xF000븁\x0000
Ummmm...\nMaybe I'm not ready to be a Gym Leader?
I have to consider what I will be\nby trying a lot of things!
I wonder if being good at sports\nand being good at battles are related?\xF000븁\x0000
It was very helpful...
Ummmm. You are\nquite interesting.\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease have this!\xF000븁\x0000
Both sports and Pokémon are\nlike a science for me!
I am stuck inside the lab,\nwith a medicinal smell every day,\xF000븀\x0000\nand then I get stressed out.\xF000븁\x0000
Waaaaaahhh! Frustrating!
Breaking out made me feel better!\nHere's a token of my appreciation.\xF000븁\x0000
Let's have another Pokémon battle\nsometime, so we won't be stressed out!
These are not shorts!\nThese are half pants!\xF000븁\x0000
You were so strong that\nmy half pants almost fell down!
You are awesome!\nHere's an awesome gift for you!\xF000븁\x0000
I envy basketball players.\n'Cause they wear shorts, not half pants.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut baseball and football\nuniforms are also cool!
Mmm!\nYou smell like an athlete!\xF000븁\x0000
I see. That is the smell\nthat strong people give off...
You seem to be getting even stronger...\nOK. Please take this.\xF000븁\x0000
I hope you will get even stronger\nby using it.
Wow, you have a lot of Badges.\nLet me see your skills!\xF000븁\x0000
That fighting style reminds me\nof the old days!
A person like you should use\ntop-shelf items--like this!\xF000븁\x0000
No matter how old we get,\nlet's stay Trainers!
Cheering makes us\nthirsty. Right?\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you can win against me,\nI'll give you a drink!\xF000븁\x0000
The battle made me\neven thirstier!
Here you are.\nI will give you something good!\xF000븁\x0000
At a place like this,\nit's good to drink a lot of water!
Cheering makes us\nthirsty. Right?\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you can win against me,\nI'll give you a drink!\xF000븁\x0000
The battle made me\neven thirstier!
Here you are.\nI will give you something good!\xF000븁\x0000
At a place like this,\nit's good to drink a lot of water!
Let's have a battle on these grounds,\nwhich I keep looking sharp!\xF000븁\x0000
The best battle\non the best ground!
OK! I will keep the grounds\nlooking perfect!
This air of excitement brings back\nmemories. In those days, I was also...\xF000븁\x0000
It makes my old wound ache...
I may not look like it,\nbut I used to be quite an athlete.
Are you a criminal?!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, you are not a criminal...\nSorry! Lo siento!
I'm here because I heard someone\naround here was faking points.
What? A battle at a place like this?\nWait! Everybody is watching us!\xF000븁\x0000
Well, thanks to you, \nI overcame my stage fright.
What? Nobody is watching me?\nNooooo. Look at me, please!
I want you to tell me something!\xF000븁\x0000
You showed me your full strength!
I will work at the Battle Subway\nfrom now on, but...\xF000븀\x0000\nwhere is it?
I want to play tennis\nlike a strong athlete!\xF000븁\x0000
Joe: A no-point game\nagainst you 'cause you're strong...\xF000븁\x0000\nRoss: A no-point game\n'cause we could not win at all!
I want to be as good a Cyclist\nas a strong person like you...
Only one Pokémon?\nThen, we cannot have a battle.
I want to play ball\nlike a strong athlete!\xF000븁\x0000

I want to learn more from\na strong person like you...
Only one Pokémon?\nI prefer a doubles match.
Whoosh! Whoosh!\nI can fight like that!\xF000븁\x0000
Joe: Fffffft...\nFffffft, fffffft... The ball needs air.\xF000븁\x0000\nRoss: Faaaault!\nI missed a serve!
They can keep moving\nfor such a long time.\xF000븁\x0000\nSmashers are really great!
Whoosh! Whoosh!
Hah!\xF000븁\x0000\nDid you see my power serve?\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd my Pokémon is\neven stronger!\xF000븁\x0000

The person who controls his serves\ncontrols the game.\xF000븀\x0000\nI will practice my serves a bit more.
Hah!
I love to watch professionals play!\nYaaaay! I won't lose, either!\xF000븁\x0000
Ai: What?\nDid we lose...?\xF000븁\x0000\nCiel: Ouch... I knew watching a game and\nplaying it are different!
Watching a professional game\nmakes me strangely confident!
Exciting!
I want to move elegantly, too!\nHey! Have a battle with me!\xF000븁\x0000

When professionals are playing,\nit looks so easy...
Thrilling!
Oh!\xF000븁\x0000\nAthletes are looking over this way!\nLet's have a battle to impress them.\xF000븁\x0000
Masa: Agghhh!\nWe showed them an embarrassing scene.\xF000븁\x0000\nYas: Hurrah! Hurrah!\nMy Pokémon! What...?
I thought they were looking at us, but\nthey were looking at their opponents...
Is that athlete looking at me?\nNo, he's not.
If I win in a Pokémon battle,\ncheer for this team.\xF000븁\x0000

I lost, so I will cheer for you!\xF000븁\x0000\nHurray! Hurray! Go you go!\nHustle! Hustle! Go you go!
Ummmm. The cheering for this team\nis not nearly loud enough...
Look at this buff body!\nAnd the Pokémon that support it!\xF000븁\x0000\nLet's have a Pokémon battle\nto show off my greatness!\xF000븁\x0000
Masa: The greatness of basketball...\nI think you got it.\xF000븁\x0000\nYas: Shall we curl up \nlike balls?
The important thing in basketball\nis outstanding teamwork!
Hmph! Hmph!\xF000븁\x0000\nFirst-class athletes \nspeak with their backs.
The way the athletes scramble\nfor that ball...\xF000븁\x0000\nI wish they'd fight over me that way!\xF000븁\x0000

From the ball's point of view,\nit's like, please don't fight over me!
The way the athletes scramble\nfor that ball...\xF000븁\x0000\nI wish they'd fight over me that way!
If you win, I will tell you\nwhy I like basketball!\xF000븁\x0000
Kat: Come on!\xF000븁\x0000\nPhae: Look! Even though we lost, \nthe ball is still spinning!
When you are watching basketball,\nit reminds you of fruit in a basket,\xF000븀\x0000\nand it looks delicious. Right?
Basketball... No, no. For a battle, \nyou need to have two Pokémon.
My special skill is that I can\nspin a ball on my finger.\xF000븀\x0000\nI can spin it forever!\xF000븁\x0000

I want to have Poké Balls\nwith the same designs as\xF000븀\x0000\nthe balls used in sports!
Basketball... No, no. For a battle,\nyou need to have two Pokémon.
Look!\nMy defense is magnificent!\xF000븁\x0000
Hawk: It's strange. When professionals\nare playing, it looks so easy...\xF000븁\x0000\nDar: I guess we cannot play\nquite as well as the professionals...
Rock-solid defense!\nThat's a real thrill in football!
DE-fense! DE-fense!
Look!\nMy magnificent offense!\xF000븁\x0000

Offense that smashes in every direction!\nThat's a real thrill in football!
Offffffense!
The bond of football fans\nis stronger than any tackle!\xF000븁\x0000
Hawk: The bond between you and\nyour Pokémon is strong, too!\xF000븁\x0000\nDar: This feeling will go well past\nthe goal line...
Football is knockdown amazing,\nbecause you can feel the excitement,\xF000븀\x0000\nthe bond between players and the crowd!
Our bond as fans\nis way stronger than this!
My cheer will go over the goal line\nand will be heard for a million miles!\xF000븁\x0000

When I cheer for my team\nuntil I get thirsty,\xF000븀\x0000\nFresh Water tastes even better!
Come on! Cheer louder!\nYell! Yell!
I mainly play on offense.\nMy friend is mainly defense.\xF000븁\x0000\nI will show you the teamwork\nof football fans!\xF000븁\x0000
Cam: The teamwork of your Pokémon\nis outstanding!\xF000븁\x0000\nAbby: I'm super impressed!
If what you want to do is different\nfrom what your partner wants to do,\xF000븀\x0000\nit's hard to win a Double Battle!
You know, football is a team sport!\nPlease prepare at least two Pokémon!
Double Battles!\xF000븁\x0000\nThis is the best way to feel\nthe heat of the game of football!\xF000븁\x0000

The right play can turn a game around...\nPokémon battles are the same, too!
Double Battles!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou need at least two Pokémon\nto feel the heat of the game of football!
Boom-boom-badum! Ha! Boom-boom-badum!\nListen to the fans' drumbeat!\xF000븁\x0000
Les: Thank you for listening to the beat\nof our spirit!\xF000븁\x0000\nWeb: Thank you for listening to the yell\nof our spirit!
Ha, pan-pan-papan, hey-hoo!!\nNext, we will use this rhythm!
Bam-bam-bam! Ha! Bam-bam-bam!\nI see the end coming?
Beep-beep-beep! Ha! Ta-roo Ta-raaa!\nListen to the fans shout!\xF000븁\x0000

Pan, pan-papan, hey-oo!! Right?\nOh, the rhythm is wonderful!
Beep-beep-beep! Ha! Ta-roo ta-raaa!\nListen to the fans shout!
Olé, olé, oléeee!\nThis is the fan song I wrote!\xF000븁\x0000\nThe Pokémon listening to this song\ntry harder than usual!\xF000븁\x0000
Kay: Olé, olé...\nHuh? It's over.\xF000븁\x0000\nAli: You are very strong!
“Olé!" means\n“Go!" or “Move forward!"
Olé, olé, oléeee!\nI am cheering now!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you have two Pokémon,\nI don't mind battling with you!
My friend came here with me...\nShe comes 'cause she wants to sing\xF000븀\x0000\nmore than cheering for the team.\xF000븁\x0000

I am a fan of all the players\nwho are doing their best!\xF000븀\x0000\nSo, I want both teams to win!
With only one Pokémon,\nit's a bit hard to battle.
Hey, you!\nDo you know what offside means?\xF000븁\x0000
Kay: What we just saw is offside!\nI bet it's offside!\xF000븁\x0000\nAli: B... Baaaaah!\nI won't tell you anymore!
What? What is offside?\nEr... The girl next to me knows!
Off!
Hey, shall I tell you\nabout the offside penalty?\xF000븁\x0000

Offside is when...\nEr... The girl next to me will explain!
Side!
The bases loaded with two outs\nin the bottom of the ninth inning...\xF000븀\x0000\nAfter that... Isn't that obvious?\xF000븁\x0000
Alf: Strike!\nGame over! Yes, the end!\xF000븁\x0000\nFred: Ah, my Poké Ball!
A game-winning homer...\nWe always hope for that clutch play!
Striiiiike!!
I don't have a home-run ball,\nbut I do have a Poké Ball!\xF000븁\x0000

I wish I could catch a home-run ball\njust once!
Ball!
Hit a home run!\xF000븁\x0000
Ami: We're slammed.\xF000븁\x0000\nEira: I'm going home.
Elesa's fashion sense\nis funky, too.
A one-on-two battle is\ntoo funky!
Hey, what does “long ball" mean?\xF000븁\x0000

What I heard is\nit means a home run.\xF000븁\x0000\n“Homer" also\nmeans a home run!
We two battle together, so\nyou need two Pokémon!
Hey, you!\xF000븁\x0000\nDon't smile at my favorite player.\xF000븁\x0000
Ami: Argh! We lost,\nand it's your fault.\xF000븁\x0000\nEira: You should try harder.\nDon't drag me down.
The only thing we have in common\nis that we like the same team.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut really, isn't that the most\nimportant thing for a fan?
Argh, because of you, \nwe're in a big pinch.
Argh, annoying!\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's none of your business\nwho I cheer for.\xF000븁\x0000

Our teamwork is sooooo bad,\nexcept when we cheer during games.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut we really don't care\nabout any time but game time.
No way! Argh, we are losing\nbecause you are not really trying!
I am quite strong.\nI will work out today, too!\xF000븁\x0000
I... I got worked over.
Your strength!\nYou pack quite a punch!
POWER!!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you have power that nobody can beat,\nyou can win both Pokémon battles\xF000븀\x0000\nand football games!\xF000븁\x0000
I...still don't have enough power?
Mmmm... Maybe I should\ntrain more...
Pokémon and Poké Balls\nare my real friends!\xF000븁\x0000\nJoin the training of\nour Pokémon Eleven!\xF000븁\x0000
Aghhhhh! I am still such a rookie!\nBut I have more guts than anybody else!
My Pokémon and I still haven't\npracticed enough...\xF000븁\x0000\nTo put it in levels, we're maybe a ten...
I am stronger than ever.\nI will work out today, too!!\xF000븁\x0000
I got worked over.
A swing and a miss...\nI can't keep up with your strength!
POWER!!!\xF000븁\x0000\nWith my ripped muscles,\nI will overcome everything!\xF000븁\x0000
I still don't have\nenough muscles...?!
Maybe I should change\nmy training regimen...
Pokémon and Poké Balls\nare my real friends!\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease join the training of\nour Pokémon Eleven!\xF000븁\x0000
Aghhhhh! I'm still such a rookie!\nI have more than enough guts, though!
My Pokémon and I\nstill haven't practiced enough...\xF000븀\x0000\nTo put it in levels, we're about a 20...
I am the strongest.\nI will work out today, too!!\xF000븁\x0000
I...got worked over!
Your strength is\nhome-run class!
POWER!!!!\xF000븁\x0000\nI will win! My superior power\ncan blaze any trail!\xF000븁\x0000
Is it possible that just having power\nis not enough...?
Football games and Pokémon battles\nboth require power and technique.
Pokémon and Poké Balls\nare my real friends!\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease join the training of\nour Pokémon Eleven!\xF000븁\x0000
Aghhhhh! I am such a rookie!\nI've got more guts, though!
My Pokémon and I still\nhaven't practiced enough...\xF000븀\x0000\nTo put it in levels, we're maybe a 50...
I've practiced and practiced\nand become a great player!\xF000븀\x0000\nNow, let's play ball!\xF000븁\x0000
Game over!
Now, practice, practice, practice!\xF000븁\x0000\nPracticing over and over is the best way\nto be good at anything!\xF000븁\x0000\nMy hard work will make me a great player!
Kids! Please cooperate with the\nspecial training for my Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
My block was supposed to guard\nagainst even Steel-type Pokémon...
Physical therapy is over,\nso we're doing some special training.
Let me tell you about the strength\nof the team you create when\xF000븀\x0000\nyou put a strong Pokémon at the core.\xF000븁\x0000
...You taught me!\nYou are great!
It looks like a team built around\na strong Pokémon. That is, an ace\xF000븀\x0000\nhas advantages and disadvantages.
Together, my Pokémon and I\nare the world's strongest!!\xF000븁\x0000
Wow! I didn't think anyone could\ncatch my blazing fastball!
My fastballs are so fast,\nnobody can hit them.\xF000븁\x0000\nVery few can catch my fastballs\nexcept Pokémon.
I, I...\nI'm not fat, am I?\xF000븁\x0000
Ripped!
I am ripped!\nI am not fat.
I have great footwork with the ball.\nPoké Balls, too. See?\xF000븁\x0000
After I let Pokémon out of\nPoké Balls... Well, I am still practicing...
I should practice more\non Pokémon handling, too.
I play occasionally,\nbut I want to become a better player!\xF000븁\x0000\nSo I will fight\na lot of Pokémon battles, too!\xF000븁\x0000
UGHH!\nI couldn't even pass the ball!
I will do anything to play better!\nIt's over if you get complacent!
An elegant Smasher\nhas an elegant battle!\xF000븁\x0000
E-e-e-even though I lost,\nI will not panic.
Because I am a lady, I won't be,\nwell, you know,\xF000븀\x0000\nch-ch-chagrined at losing.\xF000븀\x0000\nWell, maybe a teensy little bit.
I am in the starting lineup now,\nbut I will be even better soon!\xF000븁\x0000\nI will practice with a lot\nof Pokémon battles!\xF000븁\x0000
UGHH!\nMy field positioning was terrible!
If I think about why I made a mistake\nand correct it, I'll make fewer mistakes.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd if I work to improve my strength,\nI'll get even stronger!
As a proper lady, I am elegant\nall the way down to my toes!\xF000븁\x0000
Wahhhhh! What is this??
Oh! I am a lady,\nyet I have lost my nerve...
I've always played games,\nbut now I want to be the best player!\xF000븁\x0000\nI will practice with a lot of\nPokémon battles!\xF000븁\x0000
UGHH! I missed the goal!\nI was blocked!!
I won't give up games!\nI won't accept limits!\xF000븁\x0000\nNobody can stop me\nas long as I want to improve!
I am a lady. I will challenge others\nto battle elegantly!\xF000븁\x0000
You should...\nGo easy on me!
B-b-b-because I am a lady...\nwaaaah...\xF000븀\x0000\nI will admit my defeat gracefully...
No matter how much I sweat,\nI won't smell sweaty!\xF000븁\x0000
A healthy sweat...\nBoy, I am glad that I am an athlete!
After a battle, take a bath!\nAfter eating, brush your teeth!
The world championships are coming soon!\nI will practice volleys\xF000븀\x0000\nby using you as a wall!\xF000븁\x0000
Whoa! Lemme...catch...my breath...\nThat was some good training...
You and I have just met.\nLet's start the game from the beginning!
Hey! Trainer!\xF000븁\x0000\nI will strike you from above.\nMy attack has a height!\xF000븁\x0000
That's right.\nThe Pokémon do the fighting, not me...
We always play basketball\nwith Pokémon here!
I will show you a powerful serve!\nWatch this burn in at 120 miles per hour!\xF000븁\x0000
Your attack just now...\nMore powerful!
Pokémon are sending over\nsome powerful serves so I can practice.
My Pokémon was so cute!
My Pokémon listened to what I said\nand fought for me!
You... You came here because\nsomebody manipulated you.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you can win against me,\nI will tell you the secret!\xF000븁\x0000
Argh! I can't believe\nI lost...
Ghetsis of the Seven Sages supports\nour king, and Ghetsis has\xF000븀\x0000\nthree subordinates...\xF000븀\x0000\nThey are the Shadow Triad!
If I win against you,\nrelease your Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
Plasmaaaa!\nI'm mortified.
I don't understand... Your Pokémon seem\nto be happy next to you.
Pokémon living in this Chargestone Cave\nare so beautiful.\xF000븀\x0000\nBecause they are free from people.\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, my! No, no.\nPlasmaaaa!
It's bad for ordinary Trainers like you\nto use Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's good for us members of Team Plasma\nto use Pokémon!
As a proud member of Team Plasma,\nI will gladly battle with you.\xF000븁\x0000
As a proud member of...\nTeam Plasma...
What do you fight for?\nNo, what do you live for?
OK, Trainer, you use Pokémon!\nShow me your strength!\xF000븁\x0000
...I see.\nYou're very good at using Pokémon.
Because they use Pokémon, people hold\ncompetitions to sort out the strong from\xF000븀\x0000\nthe weak...\xF000븁\x0000\nIs this fair? Is this right?\nAre Pokémon just the Trainers' tools?
The hope of Team Plasma!\nWell, it has nothing to do with you.\xF000븁\x0000
Hey! What was that?\nYou're too strong! Ugh!
The hope of Team Plasma!\xF000븁\x0000\nWe know our king will lead us.\nHe will free the Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nYou! Release your Pokémon\nand stop being a Trainer!
Since coming to Dragonspiral Tower,\nmy stress level has maxed out! The more\xF000븀\x0000\nhyper I am, the faster you'll go down!\xF000븁\x0000
Bahhh.\nI have lost my motivation.
Still, this is a great tower.\xF000븁\x0000\nI feel not only its history\nbut also its awe-inspiring power.
Brycen, Cheren...\nThey are moving around being annoying.\xF000븁\x0000
I don't understand...\nI don't understand you guys...
Why are you and the Gym Leaders\nagainst us?\xF000븀\x0000\nI just can't understand it at all.
I'm sure you also thought\n“I am strong" and “I can win"\xF000븀\x0000\nand came here.\xF000븁\x0000
Huh...\nYou thought right!
If the king of Team Plasma rules the\nworld, Trainers will disappear, and\xF000븀\x0000\ndisputes will end!
We exist to serve our lord N!\xF000븁\x0000
Ah!\nOur lord N!
Because there are nights,\nthe sun is beautiful.\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause we exist,\nour king shines...
The dawn of Unova\nhas faded in the distance...
Don't stop us!\nI told you that we wouldn't stop.
What? It looks like you can still fight!
Even though I lost, I will still say:\nPlasmaaaa, go Plasmaaaa!
My Pokémon can take that!\nI'm sure! Well, probably...
Ummm...\nThis is kinda bad, right?
Aww. I lost.
My Pokémon can take that!\nI'm sure! Well, probably...
Ummm...\nThis is kinda bad, right?
Aww. I lost.
My Pokémon can take that!\nI'm sure! Well, probably...
Ummm...\nThis is kinda bad, right?
Aww. I lost.
Oh!\nSo, you chose that move!
Every time I watch my Pokémon battle,\nit ends like this...
The Pokémon on both sides\ntried sooo hard, didn't they?
Oh!\nSo, you chose that move!

Moves that never miss\nand moves that can attack first...\xF000븀\x0000\nThere sure are a lot of different moves.\xF000븁\x0000
It's important to choose\nwhich item your Pokémon holds...
I see!\xF000븁\x0000\nLosing to you means\nthat I still have a lot to learn.
Moves that never miss\nand moves that can attack first...\xF000븀\x0000\nThere sure are a lot of different moves.\xF000븁\x0000

B-both my Pokémon and I are\ngoing to give it our all!
OK!\nThis little one is up next!
Uh-oh...\nAm I in trouble?!
Aww...\nI couldn't win...
B-both my Pokémon and I are\ngoing to give it our all!

Hi, hi! Trainer!\xF000븁\x0000\nI will let you see\nwhat kind of Pokémon I have!\xF000븁\x0000
Did you see my Pokémon?\nIt's sturdy and great, isn't it?
Pokémon with the Sturdy Ability\ncannot be knocked out with one hit!
Hi, hi! Trainer!\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease show me what kinds of Pokémon\nyou are training!\xF000븁\x0000
Great, great! I didn't know\nthat way to raise Pokémon!
When you let a Pokémon evolve, it will be\nstronger, but if you don't let it evolve,\xF000븀\x0000\nit will learn moves quicker.
I can't see up ahead\nbecause of the sandstorm!\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause I can't see,\nI'll have a battle with you!\xF000븁\x0000
S-a-n-d-s-t-o-r-m.
This parasol keeps off the sun and rain,\nbut it can't stand up to sandstorms...\xF000븁\x0000\nAh! My tears are falling on Route 4...
A battle on a raised walkway!\nThat's kind of cool.\xF000븁\x0000
Losing is uncool.\nNo, no, you are cool.
It's good to sway wildly\non a raised walkway!
I love raised walkways!\xF000븁\x0000\nBalancing is fun,\nso I often come here to play.\xF000븁\x0000
I lost, \nbut I won't stop!
If you walk on a raised walkway, you can\nmove without encountering wild Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut if you stop to rest for a while,\nyou'll fall!
Originally, Pokémon lived\nin the natural world!\xF000븁\x0000\nSo, it's good to train Pokémon\nin nature like this!\xF000븁\x0000
I will start all over again.\nWe still have time.
Twist Mountain looks complicated, but\nbasically, it's a single road.\xF000븁\x0000\nKeep cool and move forward!\nThat is the trick to reach the goal.
Being with Pokémon is natural.\nHaving a Pokémon battle is natural.\xF000븀\x0000\nWhy don't we test whether that is true?\xF000븁\x0000
We are happy to be with our Pokémon.\nThat's why we have battles!
If my Pokémon don't want to fight,\nI will quit being a Trainer.\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause there are a lot of other things\nI can do with my Pokémon.
Oh! \nMy groundbreaking research...
Prepare at least three Pokémon\nthat can fight!\xF000븁\x0000\nRotation Battles are new battles\nwith three Pokémon!
Way to go!
They were rotating too much!
Rotation Battles are shocking!!
Rotation Battles are Pokémon battles\nwith three Pokémon!\xF000븀\x0000\nSo prepare at least three Pokémon!
Today I am extremely lucky!
I didn't expect them to turn that way.\nI am so unlucky!
Huh! \nI was just unlucky today.
A Triple Battle is a new style of battle\nin which you use three Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease get three Pokémon together\nto use in battle!
OK! I will show you the results\nof my daily workouts!
The result of my daily workout...\ndidn't really show up.
I'll work even harder raising my Pokémon!
In order to have a Triple Battle,\nyou need to have at least three\xF000븀\x0000\nPokémon able to battle.
OK, everyone!\nLet's fight together!
Your Pokémon fought\nharder than mine!
There are so many things to consider,\nbut that is part of the fun of\xF000븀\x0000\nTriple Battles!
I choose a move, and\nmy Pokémon will do the move.\xF000븁\x0000\nIn a moment, that move will\nreach your Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
I lost, but during the battle,\nwe were connected. Right?
This Berry may connect\nyou and your Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000
From today to tomorrow...\npeople, Pokémon, and the world...\xF000븁\x0000\nI love this connected feeling...
I am not running now,\nbut I usually barrel through\xF000븀\x0000\nas quickly as I can!\xF000븁\x0000
I have not crossed\nthe finish line of victory!
I'm going to use this little rest\nto give you this present!\xF000븁\x0000
Run and run in cities\nand on mountain paths!\xF000븁\x0000\nRun and feel the world around you\nwith your whole being!
I am just watching\nthe dangling tip of the fishhook.\xF000븁\x0000\nSince you and I have met, let's send\nour Pokémon out to meet in battle!\xF000븁\x0000
Because I love fishing and Pokémon,\nI enjoy my life twice as much.
The dangling tip of the fishhook.\nI am just watching it.\xF000븁\x0000\nYes, in life, even meaningless things\ncan have meaning.
Ouch... Why are you\nso strong?
Wow! Wow! Great!\nYou are stroooong!!
Hey! \nYour team is strong!
Ouch... I'm so uncool...
After all, I am the strongest and greatest.\nJust kidding!
Your strength...\nAnd my strength... Right. Let's test them.
Can you be strong even if you lose?\nIs winning everything?
Pokémon battles are fun.\nBut what is it to be truly strong?
Your strength...\nAnd my strength... Right. Let's test them.

Can you be strong even if you lose?\nIs winning everything?
Pokémon battles are fun.\nBut what is it to be truly strong?
A Rotation Battle is a new kind of battle\nthat uses three Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease prepare at least three Pokémon\nfor battle!
The flow of a game changes\nevery turn in a Rotation Battle!\xF000븀\x0000\nCan you master it?\xF000븁\x0000
It made my head spin,\nand I feel dizzy...
While a come-from-behind win is possible,\nif you are a strong Trainer,\xF000븀\x0000\nyou can handle the game well.\xF000븀\x0000\nThat is the thrill of Rotation Battles!
A Triple Battle is a new style of battle\nin which you use three Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nPlease get three Pokémon together\nto use in battle!
I thought and thought\nand chose these three!\xF000븀\x0000\nTheir destructive force is overwhelming!\xF000븁\x0000
Did I position them wrong?\nOr is there a more fundamental problem?
Which Pokémon\nshould I put in the middle...?\xF000븀\x0000\nI'm still thinking about it.
My!\nSpecial Emolga?!
Fishermen read the flow of water\nor the flow of a battle!\xF000븁\x0000
The flow of the battle...\nIt's too wild to follow!
The flow of water here on Route 17\nis very wild.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you don't tap into it well,\nyou cannot go where you want!
I am good at backstroke,\nfreestyle, butterfly...\xF000븀\x0000\nAnd, of course, Pokémon battles!\xF000븁\x0000
Did I just lose a Pokémon battle,\neven though I'm so good at them??
Shall I practice my swimming?\nOr shall I train my Pokémon?\xF000븁\x0000\nHmmmm, it's hard to decide,\nso I will swim with my Pokémon!
The Pokémon is riding the wave,\nand you are riding the Pokémon.\xF000븀\x0000\nAre you riding high?\xF000븁\x0000
The big wave has come and gone...\nMy heart is calm...
If you can surf calmly through the\nrough waters of your life,\xF000븀\x0000\nyou'll be riding high!
I learned all the good points of my\nAlomomola by swimming with Pokémon!\xF000븀\x0000\nI will show off its strength!\xF000븁\x0000
What a fresh Trainer!\nReally fresh, fresh!
I'm a girl with everything...\xF000븁\x0000\nWell, everything but a place to\nput my Poké Balls!
I was taking a little break, but hey,\nI always have time for Pokémon battles!\xF000븀\x0000\nLet's enjoy it as much as possible!\xF000븁\x0000
Wooosh!\nSsshhhh!!
I'll tell you why I was taking a break.\xF000븁\x0000\nI have trouble with my bikini.\nIt could be washed away...
Did you come here by looking\nat the Town Map, too?\xF000븁\x0000\nMaps are good.\nThey tell you a lot of things!\xF000븁\x0000
I want something that's like a map but\ntells me how to fight instead of where to go.
Where shall I go next...?\nI use the Town Map to decide!
I came all the way here\nlooking for various Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000\nLet me see what kinds of Pokémon\nyou came here with!\xF000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon is...\nVery cool!!
There are Pokémon Trainers\nacross the water, too.\xF000븁\x0000\nI wonder what kinds\nof Pokémon and Trainers live there...
Fights have their own rhythms!\xF000븁\x0000\nI wonder whose Pokémon\ncan fight rhythmically.\xF000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon!\nTheir movements are right on the beat!
I am living with so many rhythms!\xF000븁\x0000\nMy rhythm, the Pokémon's rhythm,\nand nature's rhythm...
When I look down from a high place,\nI feel very good!\xF000븁\x0000\nPokémon battles are the same!\nI will fight looking down from the heights!\xF000븁\x0000
You're great!\nI can't help but look up to you!
We climb mountains because,\nno matter how hard it is,\xF000븀\x0000\nthe higher we climb,\xF000븀\x0000\nthe closer we get to the sky!
On a small rise of land...\nyou and I face each other...\xF000븁\x0000
On a small rise of land,\nI lost and was left speechless...
On a small rise of land...\nWhat am I seeing...?\xF000븁\x0000\nSo many Trainers I faced before...\xF000븁\x0000\nHow many more Trainers I can fight...\nI will cherish every battle.
Are you going deeper into Pinwheel\nForest? Or to the challenge rock?\xF000븁\x0000\nEither way, unless you are tough,\nyou'll be just rooted to the spot!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, my...\nYou are very tough!
Tough Trainer!\nI will make your Pokémon healthy.\xF000븁\x0000
Around Pinwheel Forest, many Pokémon\nuse moves to inflict problems such as\xF000븀\x0000\npoison and paralysis.\xF000븀\x0000\nIf anything happens, let me know!
Really bad!
Zowie-e-e-e!
Mmmmm...?!\nThat's how you showed up?\xF000븁\x0000
Your power exceeds my\npsychic power!
People say the Musharna that show up\nhere every Friday are a bit different.
This is a power spot!\nIt awakens your dormant power!\xF000븁\x0000
Did you spot my weakness?
To tell you the truth,\neverybody has Dream Mist.\xF000븁\x0000\n'Cause if you can make a dream come true,\nit's the same as having Dream Mist.\xF000븀\x0000\nRight?
Eeek! Why? I foresaw your move,\nand I was running away from you.\xF000븁\x0000
Eeek! I foresaw your thoughts,\nbut I lost!
Dreams slip away when they almost\ncome true...\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you don't grab important things tight,\nyou will lose them.
To research strange Pokémon, having a\nbattle is a good approach.\xF000븁\x0000\nDon't you think?\xF000븁\x0000
I cannot help but wonder...\nWhy did I lose?
No matter how much you research,\nPokémon are full of new discoveries!
I've been researching\nwithout sleeping for days.\xF000븀\x0000\nI see you, but are you a dream?\xF000븁\x0000
Theoretically, it's impossible!\nIs this a dream...?
Talking about dreams, Fennel's\nPokémon DW!\xF000븀\x0000\nThat is some great research!\xF000븀\x0000\nAre you doing Game Sync, too?
For my research on dreams,\nI will research your dream!\xF000븁\x0000
No! \nI may dream about this defeat later!
The Dream Mist of the\nPokémon Musharna...\xF000븁\x0000\nThe secret has not been unlocked,\nbut it must be a great ability.
I want to figure out\nPsychics' strange powers!\xF000븁\x0000
I decided to fight using pure logic,\nyet I lost!
The things we can explain with logic\nare half of the world...\xF000븁\x0000\nThe rest, we explain with feeling!\nBecause the world is full of wonders.
Permets-moi de te provoquer en duel afin\nque je puisse graver notre rencontre\xF000븀\x0000\ndans ma mémoire.\xF000븁\x0000
Notre combat est à jamais gravé\ndans ma mémoire!
Les paysages que nous avons admirés...\nLes gens que nous avons rencontrés...\xF000븁\x0000\nLes Pokémon avec qui nous avons\ncroisé le fer...\xF000븁\x0000\nIls resteront à jamais gravés\ndans ma mémoire.
Tu n'imagineras jamais le nombre de\npays que j'ai visités, et le nombre\xF000븀\x0000\nde Dresseurs que j'ai combattus!\xF000븁\x0000
Wah!\nEncore un formidable souvenir de voyage!
Quand j'aurai beaucoup, beaucoup\nvoyagé, je rentrerai à la maison,\xF000븀\x0000\net je pourrai raconter tout\xF000븀\x0000\nplein de choses à ma famille!
The power of thundering waterfalls...\xF000븁\x0000\nExperience the great power\nof a battle with me!\xF000븁\x0000
I cannot believe our attack\nhad no impact on you!!
I admit your strength\nand give you this gift!\xF000븁\x0000
Maybe I should train my body and mind\nby standing under a waterfall!
My Pokémon and I spend so much time\ntogether, we don't need words\xF000븀\x0000\nto understand one another.\xF000븁\x0000\nDo you think you can win against us?\xF000븁\x0000
You can understand each other\nvery well, too!
When you see this Berry,\nplease remember us!\xF000븁\x0000
I enjoy working as a Ranger, but I love\nto spend my time with Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhatever happens, I won't leave\nmy Pokémon!
Are you raising these Pokémon all alone?\nOr do you rely on Pokémon Day Care?\xF000븁\x0000
I was only thinking about Eggs...
Share this Berry with\nyour precious Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
The Pokémon Day Care on Route 3!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you leave two Pokémon there,\nyou may find an Egg!
My Pokémon are running around\nin this beautiful grassland...\xF000븀\x0000\nPlease take a look!\xF000븁\x0000
They were bouncing around\njust a few minutes ago!
Share the Berry with your Pokémon, too!\xF000븁\x0000
They must have been tired\nbecause they were running around.\xF000븀\x0000\nAww! So cute!
It's OK to have a battle\nduring a picnic. Right?\xF000븁\x0000
Fey: Your Pokémon are\ngreat friends, aren't they?\xF000븁\x0000\nSue: It was over while I was\nconsidering what my partner would do.
I think the Pokémon in the Poké Balls\ntotally understand how you feel!
We two are having a picnic together!\nDon't you have two Pokémon?
We will rattle you and your Pokémon\nwith our perfect combination.\xF000븁\x0000

To battle well in a Double Battle,\nwe have to know\xF000븀\x0000\nour partner's Pokémon moves.
We fight as a duo.\nSo you need at least two Pokémon.
I was checking for Pokémon\naround here just now,\xF000븀\x0000\nbut I am also interested in you.\xF000븁\x0000
Oh! \nWhat interesting Pokémon!
Even similar Pokémon will have\ndifferent behavior and appearances\xF000븀\x0000\nin Unova and other regions.
I was checking the landscape\naround here just now,\xF000븀\x0000\nbut I am also interested in you.\xF000븁\x0000
Oh, my!\nWhat an interesting Trainer!
The unevenness of this landscape...\nWe can tell that the flow of a river\xF000븀\x0000\ncreated the undulation.
From my point of view,\nart is feeling and logic!\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd a beautiful battle is also\nfeeling and logic!\xF000븁\x0000
I could not see your strength?!
Artists can be divided\ninto two types...\xF000븁\x0000\nSome draw what they see,\nand some draw what they can't see!
I am a wonderful Fisherman\nwho loves everything!\xF000븁\x0000\nThis Fisherman will fight\nwith wonderful Pokémon!!\xF000븁\x0000
I lost!\nBut I still love everything!
I want to go deep-sea fishing\nusing the Royal Unova\xF000븀\x0000\nthat leaves from Castelia City!
Don't be overwhelmed\nby my awesome Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000
I'm so overwhelmed that I cannot speak...
Is my fishing rod bad?\nOr is it my fishing skill that's bad?\xF000븀\x0000\nI always catch the same Pokémon.
Hm! You look like a competent\nPokémon Trainer!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf I have a battle with you,\nI may learn some secrets!\xF000븁\x0000
Yep! A strong person is strong.\nAnd a weak person is weak.
The secret of fishing...\nIsn't it “hurry up slowly"?
Hey! Please show me what kinds\nof great Pokémon you have caught!\xF000븁\x0000
Ho ho!\nThese are some impressive Pokémon!
Even if others catch great Pokémon,\nI won't get jealous.\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause my own Pokémon\nare the best ones for me!
Our Pokémon make a nice matchup!\xF000븁\x0000
Emy: No, I can't believe it!\nHow come you're so strong?\xF000븁\x0000\nLin: Our team is the best in the whole world\never! How did you beat us?
If Pokémon are good friends,\nthey will be filled with power!
What? Only one Pokémon?\nThen, we can't fight!
Our combination is the best!\nThere is no chance we will ever lose!\xF000븁\x0000

The Abilities called Plus and Minus\nare the best combination! Right?
What? Only one Pokémon?\nSorry, we won't battle with you!
While we watch the beautiful scenery,\nlet's have an exciting Pokémon battle!\xF000븁\x0000
I was absorbed in our Pokémon battle.
The quiet sound of a multitude of waves\nendlessly overlapping...\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's like a first-class orchestra...\nDoesn't it sound like that?
I will keep walking\non the sandy beach...\xF000븁\x0000\nHow about that?\nSounds pretty great, doesn't it?\xF000븁\x0000
I'd have more fun\njust walking on the beach...
I walk on the sandy beach...\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause I love footprints!
Oh?\nA lovely Trainer.\xF000븁\x0000\nWould you like to meet the Pokémon\nthat make me proud?\xF000븁\x0000
Uh...\nShocking!!
...Looking back, when I had\nups and downs, my Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nwere always there for me.
Oh, a traveling Trainer!\nLet's battle, just for fun!\xF000븁\x0000
Huh? Is it already over? Noooo!\nI want to see more Pokémon!
When Pokémon use moves, or when they\nsee you and catch your eye, your heart\xF000븀\x0000\nbeats a little faster, doesn't it?
A woman standing alone with a parasol\nin one hand at the beach...\xF000븀\x0000\nHi... Please have a battle with me.\xF000븁\x0000
The parasol can block ultraviolet rays, \nbut it can't block moves...
I heard a parasol is a must\non the beach...\xF000븀\x0000\nBut I'm the only one who has one?
What? Will you fight against me?\nIt's OK, but are you strong?\xF000븁\x0000
Ugh...\nYour Pokémon are strong!
I'm happy when I am with my Pokémon!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat means I will be happy for years\nto come! Because I'm always with them!
If I battle until I win, I will never\nultimately lose!\xF000븁\x0000
Try seven times and fall eight times...\nNo!\xF000븀\x0000\nFall down seven times, stand up eight!
The more I rise up,\nthe stronger my mind grows!\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's why I thank you for each round\nthat I lost!
Do you understand why Trainers\nand Pokémon are together?\xF000븁\x0000
You and your Pokémon share\nthe sad feeling of losing half-and-half...
With a friend, you laugh twice for happy\nthings, and you cry half for sad ones.\xF000븀\x0000\nThat is the joy of living with Pokémon.
An expert Fisherman can time many things\nperfectly and precisely!\xF000븁\x0000
Hmmmm! A lot of my timing\ndidn't go well!
You! It's impressive that\nyou have a Super Rod!\xF000븁\x0000\nOK! Probably you know, but\nI will tell you how to use it!\xF000븁\x0000\nFirst, you face any body of water,\nthen you cast with your Super Rod.\xF000븁\x0000\nNext you must focus!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhen a Pokémon bites,\n“!" appears.\xF000븀\x0000\nThat's your cue to reel it in!
On a bridge!\nFighting Trainers!\xF000븀\x0000\nIt's a perfect picture!\xF000븁\x0000
I am not weak, even though I lost.\nYou, who won, are just too strong!
On a bridge!\nA sentimental Trainer after his defeat!\xF000븀\x0000\nThis is also a good, tragic picture!
My Pokémon climbed many mountains and\nbuilt up their physiques!\xF000븁\x0000
My tears fell after the defeat.\nWatch them become an ocean!
With the Pokémon move Waterfall,\na Pokémon can climb a waterfall!\xF000븁\x0000\n...There is no move called Mountainfall.
I will battle with you,\nbut you must relax your shoulders.\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause you need to relax\nto show your ability.\xF000븁\x0000
Natural stance!\nYou are good!
When people try to do what they can't,\nthey become clumsy.\xF000븁\x0000\nIf they do what they can do very well,\nthey can always be themselves!
I will unveil my Pokémon to you!\nThey are the best in the world!\xF000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon are also cute,\nbut my Pokémon are charming!
Listen. My love for my Pokémon\nis the best in the world.\xF000븀\x0000\nNobody can beat it.
Se ripenso a quante montagne\nho attraversato in lungo e in largo,\xF000븀\x0000\nmi viene tanta voglia di una lotta.\xF000븁\x0000
Vengono in mente altre lotte in\ncui ho perso proprio come adesso!
La strada percorsa non si cambia!\xF000븁\x0000\nMa su quella da percorrere\npuò accadere ancora di tutto!
What's wrong, Pokémon Trainer?\xF000븁\x0000\nAre you lost in your journey?\nNo... In your life? At times like that,\xF000븀\x0000\nif you fight, you'll know!\xF000븁\x0000
You have no doubts\nabout your way of fighting!
Such a strong Trainer!\nPlease accept this!\xF000븁\x0000
Life itself is a journey, and it's\nnatural to get lost sometimes!\xF000븁\x0000\nSome truths you can find\nonly when you get lost!
Yoo-hoo, Pokémon!\nYoo-hoo, Pokémonnnn!\xF000븀\x0000\nYoo-hoo, are you a Trainer?!\xF000븁\x0000
A tough Trainer,\nand a tough Pokémon. I lost.
I will give you this as a sign\nof my respect for your toughness!\xF000븁\x0000
I am checking to see whether Pokémon\nthat came from other regions\xF000븀\x0000\nby Poké Transfer have escaped.
I'm looking for a place...\nthat is not in any guidebook.\xF000븁\x0000
Your strength!\nI want to put it in a guidebook!
A journey to find something new!\nThat is my goal.\xF000븁\x0000\nFor example, that big rock!\nYou can push it with the move Strength!
Amazing, to find a quiet spot like this\nright next to the big city!\xF000븁\x0000\nWow! I got a little excited,\nso I want to have a battle!\xF000븁\x0000
Well, I have calmed down.
Do Pokémon also\nfeel calm in nature?\xF000븁\x0000\nOr do they also enjoy\nthe glitz of cities?
Because all roads are connected, I can\ngo anywhere and challenge anyone!\xF000븁\x0000
I felt the bond between\nyou and your Pokémon!
I keep traveling\nto forget my sadness...\xF000븁\x0000\nBut the sad memory returns\nevery time a season passes.
I ride a Bicycle,\nI feel fresh winds,\xF000븀\x0000\nand I win Pokémon battles!\xF000븁\x0000
A pleasant wind is carrying a defeat.\n...Now, it is stopping here, though.
Most people don't know this,\nbut coming to Nimbasa\xF000븀\x0000\nand riding a Bicycle is very popular.
Ting-a-ling-ling. ♪\xF000븁\x0000\nI will have a Pokémon battle\nat this speed!\xF000븁\x0000
I'm upset because I lost,\nso I will ring the bell. Ting-a-ling. ♪
If you ride a Bicycle,\nyou zip along!\xF000븁\x0000\nIf you are with Pokémon,\nyou can do many things.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt's fun to do things\nyou can't usually do!
I am patrolling.\nI will check your strength, too!\xF000븁\x0000
You were so strong\nthat I couldn't help falling back!
Nothing scares me\nwhen I patrol with my Pokémon!
I will show you the harshness\nof the desert through a battle!\xF000븁\x0000
Desert...hot... Mouth...dry... Grfrrrfl...
Be careful of burns!\xF000븁\x0000
If a Pokémon gets a burn, \nit also weakens physical attacks.\xF000븀\x0000\nThis works quite well!
Scorching desert!\nA passion for adventure!\xF000븀\x0000\nAnd a heated battle!\xF000븁\x0000
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!!
Speed is crucial\nto treat a burn!\xF000븁\x0000
Whether it is hot or cold,\nthere is no problem if you have passion!
But you are just so relaxed! How could you\nwin against a busy person like me?
Oh, my! How strong you are!
Oh!\nImpressive strength!
Oh... I lost.\nYou're very strong!
What?\nHow could I lose?
This...\nThis is ridiculous!
Your strength was more than I imagined!\nI am pleased!
Come on! Seriously?! All I did was\ntake away people's Pokémon.
We finally reached the secret sleeping in\nthe basement of the lighthouse.\xF000븀\x0000\nI won't let you interrupt us!\xF000븁\x0000
I am bitterly disappointed...
In the basement of the lighthouse\nbuilt over 200 years ago,\xF000븀\x0000\nthe mythical Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nVictini was sleeping!
I was ordered not to let anyone\napproach the Plasma Ship!\xF000븁\x0000
I lost the battle though...
Although I lost, I won't move!\nI will follow my orders!
We will release Victini\nfrom its confinement\xF000븀\x0000\nin a small basement on the island!\xF000븁\x0000
You're sabotaging\nour noble cause!
Selfish people are making\nVictini suffer...
The Victini on this island\ncreates limitless energy!\xF000븁\x0000
You are just a kid!
If you are exposed to Victini's energy,\nyou can win any kind of battle.
I failed to seize the victory!
The beginning is always important\nfor both battles and novels.
Oh... I guess it's time to start\nmy last chapter.
The epilogue of this story\nis about to begin.
Wow. I'm stunned.\xF000븁\x0000\nFor all the words I know, I can't figure out\nhow to say this... Putting my feelings\xF000븀\x0000\ninto words would just be a trap.\xF000븁\x0000\nAll I will say is I feel you're even greater\nthan I thought!
You use the move here...\nIt's good. It's fascinating.
Well... I've never withdrawn\nfrom any battles.
Even in this situation,\nthere must be a way...to win.
If somebody wins, the person who fought\nagainst that person will lose.\xF000븀\x0000\nThat's battle.\xF000븁\x0000\nA good contender just seeks the next\nvictory without bragging after winning,\xF000븀\x0000\nand without getting upset after losing.
Oh! Strong as usual.\nThat makes my heart dance!
The last one!\nI'll use the last bit of strength!
Oh... This may be the last.\nI will put everything into the next move!
There is no strongest Pokémon or single\nbest combination...\xF000븁\x0000\nSo, there are no guarantees of winning.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut the determination to be strong and to\ncontinue to grow and improve is itself a\xF000븀\x0000\ngreat strength. It's the determination\xF000븀\x0000\nthat you show that makes me respect you.
A wonderful time is about to start.\nI like this moment...
I will stay cool and collected, even though\nthis isn't going well...
I will not give up...for the sake of my\nPokémon that believe in me.
As you have always been...or even more\nthan ever...\xF000븀\x0000\nyou are an elegant and excellent Trainer.\xF000븁\x0000\nYour Pokémon also have class.\nI am very pleased to have battled you.
Do you really think you can stop us\nwith that?
My last friend...\nPlease share your courage with me!
Is the world going to choose you,\nand not me?!
Everything’s ruined. The ideals I held...\nThe dreams Pokémon shared...
Your Pokémon look happy.
Even if I lose, is it different from the\nfuture I saw?
The result was the same...\nBut you... Who are you?
When was the last time\nI was driven into a corner like this?
You haven't won yet! I won't let\nsuch a fun battle end so easily!
My heart is pounding so hard because I had\nsuch a heated battle with you.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou are a really great Trainer!!
I bought new boots,\nso I came all this way to get them dirty.\xF000븁\x0000\nYou're right! If I have a battle,\nthey may get even dirtier!\xF000븁\x0000
Oh! My boots got completely soaked\nin the battle!
I would feel sorry for boots\nif I cared about them getting dirty.\xF000븁\x0000\nPokémon are the same. Right?\nI feel sorry for them getting hurt,\xF000븀\x0000\nbut it makes them stronger.
If there are Trainers,\nI just have battles with them.\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause they may show me\nWater-type Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nI've never seen.\xF000븁\x0000
I've never seen\nsuch a strong Trainer!
If I find water, I drop in my fishing line.\xF000븁\x0000\nBecause even with a puddle,\nthere may be Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nthat I've never seen.
Knowing oneself, knowing the other,\nand knowing the surroundings...\xF000븀\x0000\nThat's a Ranger!\xF000븁\x0000
I guess there's still\na lot I don't know!
If you are prepared,\nyou don't have to worry!\xF000븁\x0000
I'm researching what kinds of\nPokémon live around here.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat way, I can plan which Pokémon\nI should take along.
Pokémon Trainers nurture friendship\nwith their battles!\xF000븁\x0000
This feeling of defeat...\nis like a bottomless swamp...
Please accept this Sitrus Berry\nas a token of our friendship!\xF000븁\x0000
Stay still and listen carefully!\nHear the sounds of nearby Pokémon...\xF000븀\x0000\nthe breath of trees and swamps.
I got tired of Pokémon battles\nwith the same people,\xF000븀\x0000\nso I want to have a battle with you!\xF000븁\x0000
Wow! Surprising!\nThe move just now was great!
The Pokémon called Burmy\ncan change their forms\xF000븀\x0000\ndepending on where they battle!\xF000븀\x0000\nIsn't that great??
Eeek!!\xF000븁\x0000\nHey! Don't sneak up\non me like that!\xF000븁\x0000
Argh, I lost again...\nI'm a little bit sad.
I was writing this and that on the wall.\xF000븁\x0000\nOh, I will never show it to you!\n...Because it's my secret!
Let's compare whose Pokémon\nare stronger!\xF000븁\x0000
You won!\nYour Pokémon are awesome!
I scrape my legs a lot\n'cause I'm wearing shorts.\xF000븁\x0000\nBut I'm fine!\xF000븁\x0000\nMy Pokémon lick the scraped parts!
This is our playground!\xF000븁\x0000\nGreat Landorus, watch out for us!\xF000븁\x0000
Wahaha!\nYour Pokémon looks like it is having fun!
Great Landorus...\nIs it a strong and kind Pokémon?
If you have the move Dive,\nyou can dive and sink!\xF000븁\x0000
Blub, blub, blub...\n...I am sinking.
Have your Pokémon\nlearned the move Dive?\xF000븁\x0000\nDive is good! Great!\n'Cause it's Dive!
I just love swimming, so I have only\nfought against wild Pokémon.\xF000븁\x0000
I guess people get strong\nby visiting Gyms!
OK! I will challenge Pokémon in Gyms\nall over the world!\xF000븁\x0000\nWhere do I find Water-type Gyms...\nKanto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh, right?
My Pokémon and I are always swimming.\nOf course, I can battle while swimming!\xF000븁\x0000
I lost. But I'm still cool, because not many\npeople can say they battled while swimming!
They say a temple sank\nto the ocean floor in Undella!
Seeing a Pokémon use its best moves\nagainst another Pokémon\xF000븀\x0000\nis really an adventure!\xF000븁\x0000
The adventure is over already.
I am on vacation\nall year round...
Oh? Did you come here to see\nCynthia in a bathing suit?\xF000븁\x0000
You should put on a bathing suit and swim\ninstead of riding on a Pokémon!
I heard that Cynthia swims secretly\nwhen nobody else is around.\xF000븁\x0000\nAnd I heard she is great!\nJust great!
The sea waves in Undella Town are\nnice and calm!\xF000븁\x0000
Your battling style\nis very rough and ready!
Floating in the sea, very nice!\nBeing with Pokémon, very nice!
What I learned after reading many books\nis that there are still a lot of mysteries\xF000븀\x0000\nin the world!\xF000븁\x0000
How we can be friendlier with Pokémon\nis also a mystery.
The book I am reading now was\nwritten by Professor Juniper.\xF000븁\x0000\nIt says the origin of Pokémon\nis still a mystery.
I've been researching the Village Bridge,\nbut taking a break is also important!\xF000븁\x0000
You and your Pokémon!\nYou are supporting each other perfectly!
In the Village Bridge,\na lot of bricks support each other\xF000븀\x0000\nand keep the bridge from collapsing.\xF000븁\x0000\nThat's how the bridge has kept its shape\nfor over 100 years.
My journey has taught me\nthat everybody loves Pokémon!\xF000븀\x0000\nI'm sure you love them, too.\xF000븁\x0000
