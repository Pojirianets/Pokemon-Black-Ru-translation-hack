\xF000븉\x0001\x0001First, I must tell you...\nI am the king of Team Plasma.\xF000븉\x0001\x0000
\xF000븉\x0001\x0001Ghetsis asked me to work with him to save\nthe Pokémon.\xF000븉\x0001\x0000
\xF000븉\x0001\x0001I wonder how many Pokémon\nexist in this world...\xF000븉\x0001\x0000
Wow... As I thought, it's high...\nAh... I may be getting scared...
Ugh... It's swaying... Isn't it? It is!\nI'm scared of how high up we are...
Ahh... No, no... This is my limit.\nHere... Sit a little closer, OK?
It's getting higher and higher...\nUlp. This is going faster than I thought.
Oh! Come look here!\nLook! Ulp, I'm not feeling so good...
... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ...
I thought I'd enjoy this ride, but I feel\nlike I'm enclosed in a tiny little space...
Luckily, I'm not scared of heights.\nThat would not be cool for a Hiker.
I'm gonna stay cool. Feel cool on the\ninside, look cool on the outside.
Uh-oh. It's higher than I thought.\nUlp. It's swaying more than I expected.
Oh! Don't move! We'll fall!\nDo...not...move...
Eep... I can't take it. This is my limit.\nW-w-will you hold my hand?
It's a great view... G-great...\nB-b-but...
I'm not crying. I'm not...\nSorry... Can I sit next to you?
Just...just until we start to descend...\nPlease...stay...
Um-hmm...\nSince we have time, shall we talk?
Um-hm... That's right... No way!\nThen... Um-hmm... Yes, yes... Um-hm...
Said...I like you... Such a lie.\nIt turned out there was... Uh-huh...
Yay! Yaaaay! It's going round and round!\nYaaay! Yaaaay! It's going up and up!
Yaaaay! So high up! Up in the sky!\nHee hee. It's fun!
Look how far we can see!\nLook! Please, Trainer?
The city is getting smaller and smaller...\nSuch a pretty sight...
Krrf! Krrrf! Krrrf!\nSorry... It's a bit chilly for me...
I think it's finally warming up. I'm\nfeeling better. Thanks for the company.
